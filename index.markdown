I am a senior research scientist at J.P. Morgan Artificial Intelligence Research. I hold an M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a B.A. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley. As a member of Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research, one of the world's foremost A.I. research labs, I did work in robotics, deep reinforcement learning, and computer vision. My full resume can be found [here][resume].

When I'm not researching AI, I like to write and make videos. I aim to use my background to communicate ideas in AI and open up conversations about the effective use of technology.
