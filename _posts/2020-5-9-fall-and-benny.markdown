SCENE 1

Bennie and Fall sit on a bench in Central Park. Or rather Fall lies along the length of the bench  with a book over her face and Bennie sits on the cement beside it.
{:act}

BENNIE
{:dc}
You indulge in darkness.
{:dc}


FALL
{:dc}
I what.
{:dc}

BENNIE
{:dc}
You indulge in darkness.
{:dc}

FALL
{:dc}
Explain.
{:dc}

BENNIE
{:dc}
You-- you-- you know.
{:dc}
(he gestures grandly with his hands)
{:paren}
You make it this big thing. This big show of, like, how fucked up your life is and how dark it is in your head.
{:dc}

FALL
{:dc}
I feel like that’s a fucked up thing to say to someone.
{:dc}

BENNIE
{:dc}
I don’t think so.
{:dc}

FALL
{:dc}
But I mean... Well, hold on -- aren’t you saying that my life isn’t fucked up then.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
I never said that.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
By implication.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Well then you’re implying -- err, inferring.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
That’s what people do, people infer. We’re inferring machines.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
That’s not my problem.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
And when you say things, you leave little spaces where the other person can infer, but not so big that they fall through.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
You’re doing it again.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
What?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
You’re going abstract on me, you’re not talking to me anymore.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Now that’s abstract.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
No, you’re lecturing at the world. You’re talking to the birds or something.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Are you saying my life isn’t fucked up?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
I never said that!
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
So you agree that my life is fucked up.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
I agree that it can be fucked up. Has been fucked up. From time to time. But is? I don’t know. That’s a big thing to say.
{:dc}
Silence.
{:act}
BENNIE
{:dc}
What’re you thinking.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
I’m reading.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
You’re not reading.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
“Furthermore, you’re aware that this is the kind of choice that will cast a lingering shadow. Every choice is a renunciation, or an infinity of renunciations. You will be forever after aware of the road not taken.”
{:dc}
Silence.
{:act}
BENNIE
{:dc}
How are you doing that. It’s on your face. The book is on your face.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
I’m just doing it. How are you doing that.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Doing what.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Exactly.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
(nods appreciatively)
{:paren}
Fuckin’ A.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
You never say that.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
I’m trying it out. I wanna be the kind of person who says, “Fuckin’ A” like that.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Okay.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
That was cool... The-- what you did.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Thanks... I liked the “Fuckin’ A.”
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Yeah?
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Yeah. It came out real natural. Like, “Fuckin’ A.” Just like that. Like in a movie. “Fuckin’ A.”
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
“Fuckin’ A.”
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
“Fuckin’ A.”
{:dc}
A woman passing with a small dog squints at them.
{:act}
BENNIE
{:dc}
(at the dog)
{:paren}
“Fuckin’ A.”
{:dc}
WOMAN
{:dc}
(more confused than angry)
{:paren}
What did you say?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
I was talking to your dog... I said, “Fuckin’ A.”
{:dc}
WOMAN
{:dc}
Oh. Okay.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Okay.
{:dc}
The woman leaves.
{:act}
FALL
{:dc}
Fucking bitch.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
I don’t know. She was nice.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Maybe you need a cigarette. To do the, “Fuckin’ A.”
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Maybe.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
I think I want to fight my landlord.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Yeah?
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Yeah, I don’t know. Like, he’s never really done anything to me. But I still feel like he’s-- He’s my landlord, you know?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Yeah.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Like, he’s got something on me.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Yeah.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
And I don’t like that.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Yeah.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
So I think I wanna fight him. Or at least, like, I wanna want to fight him. Or like fantasize about it. Or like yell at him, like, “You motherfucker!” And then something.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Why don’t you just do it now. Like, what would you say.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Like, “You motherfucker!” Something like that. Like, “You fucking want me to pay... rent? And, like, live in this shitty apartment? And, like, every time I pass you on the stairs and you’re sweeping you give me this look that’s like, ‘Who are you?’ and it’s like, ‘I live here--’”
{:dc}
(he groans)
{:paren}
Nevermind. That was stupid.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
No, it was good. I really felt something.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Really?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Yeah. I felt like, “Woah,” for a second.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Okay. Cool.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Listen, I think I’m gonna go.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Bye.
{:dc}
Bennie wanders off.
{:act}
FALL
{:dc}
“Eighty-three percent of all corporate mergers fail to create any value for shareholders, and these mergers are only made after months and years of analysis...”
{:dc}
Lights down on him talking.
{:act}

SCENE 2

A party in Fall’s apartment. Music is blaring and people are packed in. Bennie and Fall gyrate awkwardly but confidently. A WOMAN comes up to Fall and shouts in his ear.
{:act}
WOMAN
{:dc}
There’s someone at the door.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Okay, let them in.
{:dc}
WOMAN
{:dc}
I don’t think it’s that kind of person.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Whaddaya mean.
{:dc}
WOMAN
{:dc}
I think they’re angry.
{:dc}
(she makes a “not my problem” face and walks away)
{:paren}
FALL
{:dc}
(to Bennie)
{:paren}
I wanna kick her out.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
You can’t kick people out just because they say something you don’t like.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
It’s my place.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Yeah, but this is a party, not, like, an inquisition.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Come back me up at the door.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Okay.
{:dc}
They go to the door and open it. Their landlord, Job Renkins, stands there furious. He does a lot of strong pointing.
{:act}
JOB RENKINS
{:dc}
What the fuck is going on in here?
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Hi, Job Renkins. We’re having a party.
{:dc}
JOB RENKINS
{:dc}
You can’t have a party! There are no parties here! You can’t do this-- I mean, I’m blown away!
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Absolutely.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
It's just a small one.
{:dc}
JOB RENKINS
{:dc}
Just a small one? I mean -- I’m blown away. Can you imagine the inconsideration!
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Absolutely.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Inconsiderate to who?
{:dc}
JOB RENKINS
{:dc}
To your neighbors!
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
I think it's "whom."
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
"Whom?" We invited all the neighbors.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
It's the object of the sentence, not the subject.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Oh, that's right.
{:dc}
JOB RENKINS
{:dc}
I don't care. Are you listening to me? I don't care.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Job Renkins, come on. It’s 11PM on a Friday night.
{:dc}
JOB RENKINS
{:dc}
I don’t care what time it is! And you don’t have to call me “Job Renkins,” you can just say “Job.”
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Mr. Job Renkins, it’s just a little one. It’s a very little one -- you can come in.
{:dc}
JOB RENKINS
{:dc}
I don’t want to come in! I want everybody out!
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
(to Bennie)
{:paren}
Landlords are like vampires. You have to invite them in... Fuck, that didn't land, did it?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Is that true? Oh, it's a joke.
{:dc}
JOB RENKINS
{:dc}
I want everybody out!
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Look, Mr. Job Renkins, if you’re not coming in, I’m going to have to close the door.
{:dc}
JOB RENKINS
{:dc}
No-- no!
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
I’m sorry, but you’re letting all the sound into the hall.
{:dc}
He closes the door. Job Renkins pounds on it.
{:act}
BENNIE
{:dc}
I don’t know if you should have done that.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Well I did it.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
That’s true.
{:dc}
They stand there a moment listening to Job Renkins screaming at them.
{:act}

SCENE 2.5
{:dc}
A pretty woman stands around talking to Fall and Bennie. She’s trying to talk to Fall mostly, because he’s pretty as well.
{:act}
ALLEGRA
{:dc}
What do you do?
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Do? Most days I guess I just sit around.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
She means for work.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Oh, for work--
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
We’re both retired tech trash. Err, well, not really retired. More just like we quit. Yeah, we quit.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
We quit.
{:dc}
ALLEGRA
{:dc}
You quit?
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Yes.
{:dc}
ALLEGRA
{:dc}
How old are you? Oh, sorry -- I guess that’s rude--
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
No, no. I’m 24.
{:dc}
ALLEGRA
{:dc}
And you quit. For good?
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
I mean, that would be retired. We’re not retired. Can’t be.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Sort of just waiting around for the money to run out.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Yeah, I mean, it sounds kind of funny, but we both just decided we didn’t want to work anymore and so we stopped.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Worked for a few years in "the valley" as they say...
{:dc}
(no one laughs and he groans)
{:paren}
So then hit a wall and just quit.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Yeah, like sort of a soul wall. Like a wall in our souls.
{:dc}
ALLEGRA
{:dc}
Oh.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Like, “beneath all of the performed happiness and scripted fullness of Silicon Valley life lies a deep-seated discontent.”
{:dc}
ALLEGRA
{:dc}
What was that?
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
I was quoting something. Or, like, that could be a quote. I just said it.
{:dc}
ALLEGRA
{:dc}
I’m going to get another drink.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
All right.
{:dc}
(to Bennie)
{:paren}
I wanna kick her out.
{:dc}
