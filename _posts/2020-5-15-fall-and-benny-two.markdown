SCENE 1


Fall throws a tennis ball at the wall and catches it, over and over. Bennie watches this in a sort of daze.
{:act}
FALL
{:dc}
Are you ever just so totally flummoxed by the number of things you could do that you don’t do anything?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Every minute of every day.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
It’s like, I was sitting in my room yesterday. And I woke up at noon and I thought, “Okay, that’s okay, I have the whole day and half the night.” And then I thought, “Okay, today I want to learn how to code.” Something simple -- like a website. But then I thought, “I should learn about finance.” Because I don’t know about stocks and I feel like I should know about stocks. And then I thought, “I should get back to writing poetry.” Because I haven’t written in so long. And then I thought, “I should start keeping a sketchbook again--”
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Your drawings were really nice.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Right--
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
You had really good
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Right--
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
And there was this sense of incompleteness that was almost intentional, and it was like -- “Wow.” You know? Like it was improvised.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Right... Thank you... But so then I was switching back and forth between tabs and between my empty sketchbook and my empty Word doc and it was making me so anxious that I didn’t actually do anything.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
So what’d you do?
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
I just sat there for four hours and then called it a day and watched YouTube.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
At least you tried.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
See, yeah, but no, right? I can’t be doing that. I can’t be giving myself participation trophies for, like, life.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Why not?
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Because that’s psychotic! That’s like saying, “Hey, good job not killing yourself today.”
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Some philosophers would say that’s the hardest thing of all.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Like who?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
I’m sure one of them has.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
You can’t do that.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
The point is, go easy on yourself.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
The point is, I didn’t do anything yesterday and I feel bad about it and that’s okay, right? I don’t have to feel good about myself all the time. Sometimes I do bad things and I should feel bad about them.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Well, sure, but you don’t have to beat yourself up about it. Doing things is like falling asleep -- the more you think about it the less likely it is to happen. You’re going to give yourself performance anxiety.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
I feel like that’s this self-help-y positive affirmation bullshit that totally erases like, most of my daily experiences.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Now you’re being obtuse.
{:dc}
Silence.
{:act}
FALL
{:dc}
Sorry. I’m dominating the conversation again. My therapist says I should work on that.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
You have a therapist?
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Well, she’s like my step-mom or whatever? But she’s pretty much my therapist.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
She’s like your step-mom.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
I mean she is my step-mom. But I guess she’s also like my step-mom? Because I don’t really think of her like that, I think of her like a therapist that I think of as my step-mom.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Okay.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
What’d you do yesterday?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
I fucked the girl down the hall.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Oh.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Yeah.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
How-- oh, okay. Uh, how was it?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
It was all right.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Okay... I’m sorry, you fucked the girl down the hall?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Yeah, she was like in the hall or whatever fixing the hall light. It was flickering. And so I was like, “Can I help you with that?”
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Okay?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
And I guess she picked up on what I was putting down because a few minutes later she was like, “Do you want to watch _Incredibles 2_ with me,” and I was like, “Red flag but sure,” and yeah.
{:dc}
Stunned silence.
{:act}
FALL
{:dc}
Okay... All right... So-- okay-- wait, forgive me-- does this sort of thing happen often to you?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Yeah, pretty often. I’d say often.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
You just sort of wander into sex?
{:dc}
(Bennie shrugs)
{:paren}
Just sort of bump into sex in the hall?
{:dc}
(Bennie shrugs again)
{:paren}
That’s unbelievable! How does that work?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
I’ve been told I give off vibes.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
You give off vibes.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
I’ve been told that.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Okay. All right. I’m going to go.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
What?
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
I’m going to go, I’m sorry--
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
What, come on, I wasn’t bragging--
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
No, I know, but I’m upset--
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
I didn’t mean it as--
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
No, yes, no, I know, but even still, I’m going to go kick a wall or something.
{:dc}
He exits.

SCENE 2


Bennie and Fall are slumped over on a couch, passing a cigarette back and forth.
{:act}
BENNIE
{:dc}
You ever get nervous that you’re not famous?
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
No.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
I watch a lot of late night.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Is that part of it?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Not really. Maybe? I don’t know.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Okay.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
It’s like they’re up there, and people are clapping, and they’re on stage, and like, woah. You know?
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Okay?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
And then like the show ends. And all the miserable fucks in the audience go home. And they didn’t get a single frame of air time. They were just a group of hands clapping for the people who really matter.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
That’s bleak.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
But it’s like, that could be me. I could be one of those hands.
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
Two.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
I could be two of those hands. And it wouldn’t make a difference what my title is or where I work or how many kids I have, because I’m not up there, you know?
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
So famous people are the only people who matter?
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Like, no, but like, yes, you know?
{:dc}
FALL
{:dc}
I don’t think I know, no.
{:dc}
BENNIE
{:dc}
Recently, that’s how my brain thinks! And I can’t stop it!
{:dc}
