excerpt: a short reflection about the friends i've made at berkeley
---
In some ways these past four years have been a mad rush. Every day so urgent and full that I barely had time to look around and register. Most of the time spent rushing to class, then to a library, then home to finish some problem set or class project before a midnight deadline. Stringing these deadlines together for four years and then wondering where the time went.

In other ways these years have been a slow burn. The nights spent with friends, singing and playing guitar (not me, someone else). The nights spent walking down Telegraph with people I love. These nights were not as common as the problem sets but they were brilliant and shine in my memory so that everything in between fades away. The afternoons in libraries with friends by my side, working in silent camaraderie. These years have been full of love, I realize now. Full to the brim with it, and I am endlessly grateful for that. I am grateful to have met people different from me, outgoing and warm -- people who attracted other good people to them so that I could, in turn, become friends with them. People who took this achievement-hungry freshman and showed him the joys of sunning yourself on a towel in a park and strumming a guitar, of singing a song from a musical, of piling onto a couch to watch a movie. And who sacrificed none of their ambition in order to do so.

I am scared that I will move away from this place and be surrounded by career hounds. That I will lose whatever spark these people have lit in me, that I will lose this newfound looseness, the shine that comes from reflecting them. I have, since childhood, chased the approval of my parents, the achievement of my older siblings, the admiration of my peers. Sometimes at the cost of my own satisfaction. I want to be surrounded by people who beat back that ambition, which can be dark and insidious in its profundity, and who keep the light and artistic and spontaneous in me alive.  

But I recognize, too, that part of the beauty of these people I now know is that they require no fodder to be who they are. They build it up within themselves. They have some to spare, so much so that they built it up in me. If I want to remain this way it is in my hands to keep my own fires alive. And I will try to do so.
