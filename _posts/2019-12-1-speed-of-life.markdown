excerpt: some thoughts i wrote down on the arbitrariness of making big decisions
---
I think for the first time in my life I’m beginning to understand how fast the years will go by. My parents always used to say that after a certain point the milestones grow few and far between and thirty, then forty, comes before you know it. I treated this with the usual youthful skepticism. But recently, in wrestling with the torturous question of my career (“What do you want to do after graduating?”) I see how this might be true. How one temporary ambition may lead to another. How so many holdovers put in place to make room to breathe and think and plan might string together into ten years or twenty.

I hear the same sort of indecision in my friends’ voices when we talk. “If only we could slow the pace,” we all seem to be saying. But I know that I could sit here forever drafting up possible futures and never picking one. That the only way to decide is to try and err and try again and find contentment eventually in some local optimum.

Still, my friends and I talk and make crackpot schemes as thin as tissue paper based on criteria we don’t quite feel as real yet like “profitability” or “stability.” But I can see how these schemes could harden into plans into schedules into routines. I can see how easy it would be to forget that they were arbitrary, that they were gossamer strands met by desperate hands relieved to grasp at anything solid. That they were adopted merely as a thing to say. As a ready answer to the question.

And that’s all right. Because life is non-convex. There is no closed form solution, the error surface is riddled with local minima, and only stochastic iterative methods exist to optimize it. Stochastic because we are bad at optimizing in multiple dimensions at once. This is all part of the process. I’m not afraid of the local minimum. I’m just afraid that I will mistake happenstance for destiny, because then I will be stuck, too afraid to reinitialize with a random starting vector. I’m not afraid of the descent. I’m just afraid it will feel like falling.
