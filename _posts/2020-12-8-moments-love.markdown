In the background, the soft piano, and, “Let me know. Do I still got time to grow?” The car banking at eighty around the wide corner. James nodding his head, moving with the beat, singing softly. The wall of trees clearing on the right side of the highway, stretching thin to reveal the wide bowl of the South Bay. Little lights of houses rising slowly up the far foothills, the mountain beyond. All those parked cars; gas stations with glowing blue and red signs; roads laid bare; shingle roofs and childhood bedrooms; electric wires; crescendoing piano -- “Seems like streelights, glowing, happen to...” -- I think of her. I wonder where she lives, whether I could drive to it. Probably she is within fifteen minutes of me. That I could drive so little and step out onto some suburban sidewalk and wait there for her to open a front door and step onto the stoop and we would be there, a few feet apart, in the falling night. It makes me ache like crazy.

One of the girls asks us whether when it comes to love we’re, “Like, simpy, like, ‘Oh, let me take you to dinner,’” or whether it’s more like -- she makes a smacking motion with the palms of her hands. She makes a face when she explains the first option, as if describing a squashed bug. James laughs and says nervously, “I guess more like the second.” They turn to me and I say, “In between.” But the moment I say it I wonder why I’m genuflecting to the implied preference, why I’m agreeing with this idea that it’s weak to care about someone. I correct myself. “Probably more like the first, though,” I say.

“Oh, okay. I respect that, I respect that,” she says. Her face registers some note of surprise. I wonder whether she was only trying to preempt the way she imagined we thought of love.

Truth is, this city is nothing but the afterimage of you. Fire Trails sunsets remind me of you. The beach reminds me of you. Crossing the Bay Bridge reminds me of you; walking past the Campanile; walking past BAMPFA.

I took the Polaroid of you out of my wallet and put it on my wall. I don’t know what that means. I see it more often than before, but I don’t carry it with me where I go. Maybe that’s moving on or maybe it’s hanging on. I guess I’ll only know in retrospect.

I think I want to write a poem but I don’t know how to write poetry. So I’ll write it like this instead. If fate put me in a house with you forever I think I would be happy. If I woke up one day and blinked and said Where am I and turned over to see you, and you said Home, I would be happy. If we went to the kitchen that morning and every morning after and made coffee and worked quietly, sipping our coffee, you at the dining table and me at the desk, I would be happy; if you looked up without warning and rolled your eyes and complained about the guy who talks too much in your meetings; if I complained to you about not being able to find the right word -- it’s like \_\_\_, but not quite -- I would be happy. If one of us said Hey, are you hungry, and dug through the fridge to find the leftovers in tupperwares and nuke them in the microwave for a few minutes; if every once in a while I got up to bother you and read your papers over your shoulder until you said Don’t you have things to do; and I held you close for a moment and you closed your eyes before saying Okay, okay, and shooing me away; and you came over every once in a while to ask me about a line edit on one of your drafts; and I caught myself staring at you and sometimes you looked up and saw me looking and gave your little lopsided smile -- I would be happy. Endlessly happy.

In all the hours we spent together, sitting by side by side and working, I never got a second of work done. All I did was sit there thinking about her, wondering when it was next acceptable to bother her, wondering when she would be done with her work, wondering whether I could be doing mine.

Tell me the truth: when did you know you were ready.
{:dc}
I didn’t.
{:dc}
Why did you say Yes.
{:dc}
Because at the time I needed a green card, and it just made more sense with your brother on the way. And plus, we’d been dating for so long at that point that it didn’t feel like such a big deal. It was just, like, making things official.
{:dc}
You already thought you’d be with him forever.
{:dc}
Not forever, but I thought for a long time. And then when I got pregnant, I thought, well, he’d better stick around.
{:dc}
And this was one way to make sure.
{:dc}
You could say that... No, I’m just being funny, but that’s not why I did it. I think I knew he wasn’t that kind of person, who got scared of things like that. I didn’t need to anchor him to me. It was just sort of... I was pregnant. We were having a kid together. So, we were going to see it through. And so it was obvious.
{:dc}
Yeah.
{:dc}
Sometimes love is like that. Sometimes it’s obvious.
{:dc}
Yeah... And sometimes it’s not.
{:dc}
Sometimes it’s not.
{:dc}
What do you do when it’s not?
{:dc}
I wish I had a simple answer for you... But, you know, it’s not like you get some magic rulebook as you get older. Some things you can make rules for, but love is messy. And irrational. Sometimes it’s more about the feeling than what’s logical.
{:dc}
Yeah...
{:dc}
You’re sad.
{:dc}
Yeah.
{:dc}
Why are you sad?
{:dc}
I don’t know... Just... Inside.
{:dc}
Okay, inside.
{:dc}
Yeah... Like... I feel like I’m losing someone I was maybe meant to be with... Not that I believe there’s one person you’re meant to be with. But. I can’t explain it.
{:dc}
You love her.
{:dc}
I love her.
{:dc}
Yes... I can see it.
{:dc}
No you can’t.
{:dc}
Yes, really -- come on, now, you think a mother can’t see when her kid is in love?
{:dc}
Not really.
{:dc}
Well, I can.
{:dc}
Okay.
{:dc}
You know, sometimes... Sometimes it’s obvious.
