Last night I was woken by lightning. Or probably by the thunder that followed quickly behind â€“ the loudest thunder I have ever heard. I leapt to my feet and went to the window without thinking. Pressed my hands against the shuddering glass. Felt my heart in my throat and thought the world was coming to an end. A primal reaction to an animal fear. When I pieced it together I went back to bed. A minute later the room lit up again and the thunder came a half-second later. Close. Very close. Ace whimpered in the hall and I went to comfort him. I laid my head near his head and slept by his side.
