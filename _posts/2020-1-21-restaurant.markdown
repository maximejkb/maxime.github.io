excerpt: a memory from my notebook
---

It is a restaurant in its death throes. Drawers hang askew in the broken dresser along the far wall. An Internet router sits undisguised on a table in the corner. The big empty room is undecorated, shouting its plainness in gray tones. The cloth flowers in the center of each table are dusty. When Jakob walks in, he falters. The emptiness is oppressive, the silence eerie. At the sound of the opening door, the big man and the small man sitting at the bar turn in their stools and the big man says, “Gute nacht.” The small man wears a blue apron and smokes a cigarette. Two highball glasses of whiskey sit on the bar. Jakob turns without a word and leaves the place. Out in the cold street, through the frosted glass, he sees the small man return to his cigarette. The big man takes a swig from his glass. It is almost empty. Jakob thinks about the big man’s greeting -- how hollow it was, how devoid of hope. He watches the big man bum a drag off of the small man’s cigarette. The big man rests his elbow on the bar and his chin on his palm. He considers the room blankly, and Jakob wonders what he sees and what he saw when he first looked at it, dappled in sun light, swimming with dust motes, unfurnished and bare, a room of a million unrealized possibilities. Something in Jakob stirs. He turns back and enters the restaurant and sits at a table. The small man swivels, raises an eyebrow, and suffocates his cigarette in an ashtray. He heads into the kitchen. The big man lifts himself off of his stool, and Jakob sees how big he really is. Maybe he just carries himself heavily. He walks with his feet shoulder-width apart and his arms at a distance from his sides. His collared shirt’s sleeves are rolled up to his elbows and his fleshy face is shadowed by stubble; when he speaks his voice is flat but not gruff. He tells Jakob in heavily accented English, “Menu only in German, okay?”

“Okay,” Jakob says.

After a minute of staring at the menu he feels depressed. Not because it is quiet -- he loves the quiet and the solitude of the place -- but because of the big man, who sits at the bar now poring over a binder of receipts. The big man and the room seem one and the same, and this thought fills Jakob with such hopeless pity that he feels guilty for sitting down at all, for prolonging an end to which the man seems resigned. He calls the man over and tells him, “I can’t read German. I’ll have whatever you think is best.”

The schnitzel is good when it comes. The big man makes no show of it; he walks over with the plate and sets it down and walks back to the bar and goes back to his bills and his face is dead throughout. Tasting it, Jakob smiles but the big man doesn’t look up and Jakob’s smile fades. The food is good and he eats quickly. The moment he is finished he flags the big man.

“Can I get the bill?” he asks.

“Yes, of course,” the man says. He smiles bitterly. Maybe he knows that Jakob is eager to escape. Jakob makes his mind up to tip generously. As the big man hands Jakob the check he asks, almost as if indulging himself, “Did you enjoy?” Jakob wonders at the depth of the big man’s voice, the careful disinterest in his tone, and the breathy quality of his accented English. For the rest of the night, as he walks home in the swirling snow, as he lays in bed, Jakob will turn these words over, hearing them again and again: Did you enjoy? Did you enjoy? Did you enjoy?

### thoughts

I like this piece a lot now that I reread it. I remember going to this restaurant in Berlin with two of my friends. We found it depressing, but for a while after I wondered why it was so sad to me. I guess it's because it represented a broken dream, and even on such a small scale that's hard to see.
