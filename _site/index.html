<p>I am a graduate researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, doing work in robotics and computer vision as a member of Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research. My full resume can be found <a href="/assets/resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>When I’m not researching AI, I like to write and make videos. I aim to use my background to communicate ideas in AI and open up conversations about the effective use of technology. I also aim to produce videos using computational techniques to informally investigate journalistic topics that interest me.</p>

<p>I have published short fiction, essays, and journalism, and have been selected for workshops in short fiction and playwriting. I have three years of journalism experience, serving as a reporter, copy editor, art director, and opinion columnist for <em>Redwood Bark</em>. I also served as a reader for the literary journal <em>Berkeley Fiction Review</em>.</p>
