    <p>The light was gray and weak coming through the vertical blinds, and when I turned my head to match the angle of the slats I could see the sky beyond, as low and gray as an augury. Dust blackened the edges of the slats and piled on the blades of the broken ceiling fan. Maybe it wasn’t dust but ash from the cigarettes Will and I smoked indoors too frequently. Will slept on the other side of the bedroom, in his bed which was no more than six feet from mine and striped with the light coming through the window. One bar of light fell over his face and I wondered how he didn’t stir. I woke with the slightest hint of day; some days I woke just with the brightening of the eastern rim of the world, not even the rising of the sun. I wondered if Will knew how long the morning could be in coming. How it could stretch out for hours from that first lifting of the darkness to the stirrings of the streets outside, with me all the while blinking in the dimness and lying still so as not to be awake just yet.</p>
