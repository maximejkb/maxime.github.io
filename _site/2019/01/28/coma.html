    <p>Laughing, he is laughing. He is biking down a city street and the rain is coming down hard, so hard that it drums on the tops of parked cars and roars against the plastic of his drawn-up hood. The pitted asphalt under his wheels is laminated with a skin of water and the gutters on either side run full.</p>

<p>He glances backward to check for cars but there are no cars on the road and he bombs through an empty intersection without looking at the traffic light. He doesn’t care. The rain makes him feel free and giddy; he pedals into it and it blinds him. His wheels spinning on the wet asphalt sound like oil hissing in a pan. There is nobody on the sidewalk as far as he can see: as far as he can see he is completely alone, and the street rolls down and down until it comes to the broad flat expanse of the bay and the bay disappears into the fog.</p>

<p>On either side of the road are apartment buildings and parking lots, all of them gray, around eight stories tall. He is full of hate for these buildings, but he can’t remember why, and he pedals harder so that he is flying impossibly fast on the skin of water, hydroplaning maybe, he isn’t sure, and he feels weightless. He thinks suddenly that the world is still swimming, is still in flux. He remembers a clip from a film he saw when he was young of the Earth from afar with the continents drifting to and from and merging and dividing on its surface. He feels that the rain is washing away the trash on the streets and the dirt on the streets and the streets themselves; the rain is washing away the city and the bedrock of the continent; the world is not yet decided. This is a beautiful thought. He latches on to it.</p>

<p>The rain is torrential. The sidewalks flood and the sewers spill over and the bay in the distance begins to creep upward. A parking garage on his left begins to shift and on the right an apartment building slips down the hill a few feet and down by the next intersection the asphalt begins to crack and sag. The dirt underlying it all is eaten away by flood waters and now the buildings begin to crumble and slide, really slide, and the asphalt disappears under streams of running water and then it is just a river, a river of white-water rapids. The cars begin to float, and an apartment building floats by on his left.</p>

<p>He begins to sink, and he wonders where the asphalt has gone, because as his head goes under he sees that the city has fallen away. There are miles of deep water below him; though he can only see a few hundred feet down he knows there are miles below. If he looks straight down there is blackness, pure blackness, and around him the deep blue fades. He is pedaling on a falling bike. He looks to his left. Beams of sunlight slant downward toward the blackness, and a parking lot, with its crumbling concrete pillars and twisted rebar, tumbles downward in silence. It passes him. An apartment tower falls by on his right; he can see into the windows. A couch and a desk are pressed against the ceiling in one apartment. In another, papers swirl like leaves in a tea cup. More buildings fall past him. A school bus. A police car. He watches them as they pitch downward in their weightlessness and grow faint and are swallowed by the darkness.</p>

<p>He realizes that he is going to the darkness. He is afraid of this, very afraid. The light is dying around him, and when he peers into the distance he sees a swelling shadow moving slowly against the dark blue – something like a whale, bigger than he has ever seen. This frightens him too. He thinks that there is some place he must get back to, or someone, but he doesn’t remember and it is pointless to try. He is filled with a sense that these things are abnormal, but he can’t think of why. It is like something, he would say if he had to explain himself. It is like being in something, but even this he can’t remember. Everything is dark around him. He isn’t sure whether he is approaching the darkness or whether he is in it already. The sense of oddness is gone, as is the fear, and now he is calm. He feels good, even. But sad, as well, because there was some place he had to get back to. He is beyond this, he is naked and everything is dark and truly dark – for the first time when he looks down at himself he sees blackness, nothing, no light to see his body. He can’t tell if he still has eyes, there is nothing to see, and he closes them, he thinks. He is beginning to dissolve away, he thinks, he isn’t sure there is a he to speak of. He is sad, and an image comes to him unbidden. There is a boy, young, maybe six years old, with brown hair and glasses. His eyes are green, the corners of his mouth are turned up in a smile that is like a secret passed between good friends. He laughs. It is autumn, and the boy stands in a grove of half-bare trees and the ground is carpeted in orange leaves. He crouches and picks up a stick and gestures at a pile of leaves where a potato bug sits, its antennae twitching. The boy looks up and says something and laughs. There is a woman, somewhere, who laughs. This is a beautiful sound. The image of the autumn grove falls away and there is only blackness but the sound remains, and the blackness is full of happiness, and the blackness, too, fades.</p>
