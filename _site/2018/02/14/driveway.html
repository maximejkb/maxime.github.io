    <p>In the falling night I sat in the driveway by my cousins, Kim and Allison. The two of them sat on the stoop and rolled their cigarettes. They bent their rolling papers and lay down the centers two lines of tobacco taken from plastic pouches. They rolled the cigarettes with filters at one end and twisted the other ends. When they were finished Kim fished a lighter from her hoodie pocket and lit her cigarette, then Allison’s.</p>

<p>I said to Allison, “I remember you used to do this behind the house in Biot. We went on a walk, you and I and maybe Camille, and it was late in the night. You showed us how you rolled a cigarette, and then when we got home we sat on your bed and you were on Microsoft Live.”</p>

<p>The corners of Allison’s mouth lifted. She tilted her head. “Maybe. I think that was before anyone knew that I smoked.”
Kim laughed. The two sisters sat identically, with one knee drawn up to their chest and one leg outstretched, an elbow resting on the drawn-up knee, cigarette dangling from between two fingers. They sat and smoked.</p>

<p>Allison was twenty-eight and pale-skinned and fair-haired and thin. Her hair nearly glowed, even with the light so low and the sky dark and indigo. My older cousin had told me once in a hushed tone, “I always got the impression that she was fragile. Not sick, but fragile.” Kim was, if not the opposite, close. Energetic and always grinning and making jokes. She had big brown curls and wore sweatpants most days.</p>

<p>I hadn’t seen them in ten years. They hadn’t seen each other in three. They leaned against each other and Kim smiled at me. “You’ll have to come see me in Australia,” she said.</p>

<p>“Me too,” Allison said. She was leaving Paris at the end of the month to join Kim and her girlfriend in Sydney.</p>

<p>She planned to open a business breeding dogs, or maybe training them – I wasn’t sure. Allison leaned her head against Kim’s shoulder and looked up. “The stars are amazing here.”</p>

<p>“Just wait until you get to Sydney,” Kim said. She tapped her cigarette on her sandal and the ash fell away. “We can go on a road trip. You’ve never seen anything like it, I promise. There’s no one out there in the middle. You can drive for fifteen hours and not see a person, and the land is flat in places. Sometimes you can’t even look up for more than a few minutes, because there are too many stars. It makes you scared. You head starts to swirl.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like a fun place to be high,” Allison said. I laughed with her, but Kim just took a drag from her cigarette.</p>

<p>“Not really. It’s pretty at first, but it makes you panic. Really, I’m not joking. At least for me, you look up for that long, it’s like you’re losing your mind.”</p>

<p>I looked up. The stars were better than in San Francisco, but with the trees behind the house the field of view was limited. Still, I knew what she meant. On a backpacking trip to Point Reyes my high school friends and I had pitched our tents and smoked a few bowls of weed, and we stumbled through that night losing and finding one another, falling back and lying spread-eagle and frozen with the terror and beauty that we would die one day and stay dead.</p>

<p>Kim and Allison finished their cigarettes. They went inside, where my siblings, Aya, Camille, and Julien, were waiting to play a game of cards.</p>

<p>I stayed out and thought about Biot. It was a small town near Nice. Until I was ten, my parents rented a house there each summer. They sent an open invitation to the extended family, and often we had twenty or twenty-five people staying with us, each for a week or so. It was how Camille, Julien, Aya, and I met our grandparents, our uncles and aunts, and most of our cousins. It was a way of bridging the Atlantic Ocean that lay between us and the rest of our family, so that to the younger cousins, even if we were <em>les Américains</em>, at least we were not strangers. It was during the first of those summers that we met Kim and Allison, who must have been twelve and ten at the time, and played with them in the pool and lay like fish on the deck and chased each other on tricycles and ate lunch still in our swimsuits and read <em>Asterix</em> and <em>Tintin</em> until we were told to go outside.</p>

<p>After a few minutes I grew cold and went inside to play cards. We played until midnight. Then Kim yawned and Aya said, “We should let you sleep so you don’t keel over in the airport tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“I think so,” Kim said. Kim and Allison stood up. Kim looked at us from across the table and the empty bottles of rum. She said, “Maybe it’ll be another ten years until we see each other. I’ll be nearly forty.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see each other before then,” Julien said.</p>

<p>“Maybe.” Kim stretched and yawned and headed for the door. At the door she stopped and looked back and thought for a second, as if she was sure this was the last time she would see us in a very long time. She said finally, “We’ll see each other for all of our lives.” She slipped out and went to her room, and we said nothing about it and went to sleep ourselves. In the morning I woke and they were already gone.</p>

<hr />

<p>There were nights that summer that I stayed up in the darkened bedroom just listening to my brother snore. It was the first summer we spent back together after we had all left the house for college and work, and I was struck by the thought that this is what it meant to be a family of adults. We would see each other only when we could; when paid time off and hectic schedules aligned. It didn’t feel any different than it had all those nights I’d stayed up listening to my brother snore when he was ten and we shared a bedroom.</p>

<p>But sometimes I thought about the four of us growing old and distant, separated by many miles. I thought that not everyone grows old and that there were four of us, and that one day three of us would bury the fourth. Thinking this, my throat grew tight and I felt as if a great weight was pressing down on me. I listened to my brother’s breathing. Every so often there came the grating noise of his teeth grinding in his sleep. And I would think, “It will be a long time before that happens. Don’t worry, you have a long time.” And I would sleep. And it would be all right just for the night. But still I knew that we wouldn’t have each other forever…</p>
