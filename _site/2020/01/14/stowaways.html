    <p>Jakob met Anna in the library, when the two of them were students at Rice. He sat in a darkened corner of the hall, far from the slanting beams of sunlight which passed blindingly over the ranks of tables in the afternoon. Anna stalked into the hall wearing an oversized olive turtleneck as a sort of dress. She sat two tables away from him and chewed on the silver pendant hanging around her neck; maybe it was this that captured Jakob’s interest. Over the course of an hour he glanced at her one too many times. She caught him looking. She stared at him with such unamused contempt that he was forced to drop his head, unable to play off his gaze as incidental. He did not look at her again until she stopped in front of him on her way out. She stared at him again, this time almost hungrily. Then she slid a piece of paper across the table and left. On the paper she had written her phone number and the words, “be confident.”</p>

<p>They went on one date to a coffee shop. Anna told him, “Tell me something interesting about yourself,” and he rambled about the ancient Romans. Anna did not point out that he had said nothing about himself, which Jakob appreciated – he had a habit of meeting people who practiced that kind of sharp cleverness. She furrowed her brow and asked him about the crossing of the Rubicon. At the end of their date Anna said, “I like you.” She pulled him into a nearby bookstore, led him to the back room, and gave him a blowjob between two aisles of poetry collections.</p>

<p>She liked to do this from time to time, laying public claim to him, and he didn’t mind. Afterward, at his place, she would press her ear against his chest and she would talk and he would listen. She liked to talk about travel, which was to her the only worthwhile use of early adulthood, the only way to avoid the inertia of work that set in for most after college. From the outset she assumed that this was Jakob’s view as well, that they were conspirators in this regard, and he never asked her why. He worried that to ask might reveal a deficiency.</p>

<p>In fact, Jakob was never sure why Anna chose him at all. He was not particularly well accomplished or good looking. Anna was beautiful, with her close-cropped hair and angular face and green eyes. When she smoked cigarettes she did it elegantly, but not vainly, without the self-importance of the people who smoked cigarettes as a statement of counter-culture. She did it purely for the pleasure of it. When Jakob thought hard about Anna, this was what made her beautiful. She radiated joy. Not joy in the sense of laughter but a fiercer joy: joy as eagerness and hunger for living. When they walked the streets together she seemed to eat up the world with her eyes and a little smile played over her face when, for example, a bird caught in a headwind glided to a standstill or an airplane high above banked and left a curve in the sky. Jakob, for his part, was content to follow her, always observing her without meaning to, bemused in the way of a little boy watching his mother, trying to learn the patterns of the world through her eyes. He knew that he was a rather meek counterpart, and whenever they were approached at a bar or café by some hopeful who squinted at him upon being told, “That’s my boyfriend,” he smiled and shrugged, as if to apologize.</p>

<hr />

<p>After Jakob and Anna graduated from Rice, Jakob spent two months searching unsuccessfully for work. His degree was in art history, and Anna’s in literature. Jakob had always had low expectations for his employability, but these low expectations had been something to laugh at, something to joke about at parties. Until they weren’t.</p>

<p>Anna had never stooped so low as to give serious thought to something like employability. She sat at the kitchen table, often smoking a cigarette, and typed away furiously at a manuscript she would not let Jakob read. Sometimes he asked her, in roundabout ways, whether she planned on finding work. She only ever said, “I have enough work.”</p>

<p>After two months, they spent the last of what little money they had pooled together for their apartment. They had graduated at the end of their fall semester and had survived until mid-May. Jakob asked his mother for a loan, and his mother asked him to come home. He hung up the phone, went to the kitchen, and broke the news to Anna. She looked up at him with clear eyes for the first time in months and smirked, as if he had told her something she already knew. She closed her laptop and said, “Here’s what we’ll do.”</p>

<hr />

<p>Jakob was not built for the outdoors. Neither, he thought, was Anna. She was skinny and somewhat pale, and when she grew angry and lifted her head up high he could see her pulse just under her jawline, and it was slow and weak. He worried about her, secretly, and about himself.</p>

<p>For their first trip, he stuffed a hiking pack full of blankets and jackets and shirts. He bought a wind-resistant tent. He bought flashlights and a beacon and extra batteries. Anna packed her day backpack from Rice. She packed it full of non-perishable foods like saltine crackers and water purifiers. When Jakob showed her his haul she shook her head. She said, “One change of clothes.” Pulling up the hem of her shirt, she showed him the blue thermal underwear beneath. The next day, Jakob bought himself the same set. He kept two of the blankets, a flashlight, and left the tents. He filled his pack with water purifiers and food.
They spent one day moving their valuables into a five-by-five locker in a public storage facility. They had sold much of their furniture. They still owned one desk, two chairs, two laptops, two boxes of dishes, three boxes of books, and a heap of clothes. They sealed all of this behind a single padlocked door. After the door slammed shut and the attendant secured the lock, Anna and Jakob stood alone in the darkened aisle of the storage facility. Anna turned to Jakob. Her eyes were wide. She kissed him and her teeth knocked against his. He kept his eyes closed and wished that the time had already passed, that he had endured and proven himself, that they could unlock the door and sit in their chairs and be content.</p>

<p>That night they took a bus to the port of Houston, Anna wearing her puffy yellow jacket with its fur-rimmed hood and her canvas pants. Every once in a while, she turned to Jakob and pressed her lips against the back of his hand, and he could not help but be thrilled.</p>

<hr />

<p>The port was a square of concrete on the curve of the river, illuminated by orange flood lights and surrounded by a ten-foot chain-link fence, dotted by piles of shipping containers like hay bales in a field. Along the water’s edge rose a series of yellow cranes for loading and unloading. Three hangars of waiting ships sat near the shore, and docked at the piers were those in active service. The cranes, too, were unmanned, and they worked steadily, pulling containers from the autoships and stacking them in a heap. Jakob and Anna sat watching for ten minutes, and even in the late night one new ship pulled in to its bay and was unloaded.
The only people in the port were the few security guards who languished at the gates where truck drivers idled before entry – there were only two trucks grumbling in line when Jakob and Anna arrived – and the customs officials and maintenance crew who patrolled the lot or filled out paperwork in the main office. Most of these workers were gone for the day. It really was just the security guards, and looking down on the port, lit up and silent except for the whirring of the crane, Jakob felt that he was looking at some last settlement of man, some desert or graveyard.</p>

<p>Anna and Jakob set off into the shrubbery by the side of the road about a mile from the front gate. They cupped their flashlights with their hands to keep the light low and cut a straight line from roadside to fence.</p>

<p>Jakob felt his heart thumping on the side of his neck. He watched Anna, who eyed the guards at the distant gate. He hoped that a dog would bark or a guard would turn and point a finger and Anna would step back into the bushes. For just a moment he thought of reaching out and placing a hand on her shoulder. But the moment passed and Anna leaped forward and hooked her fingers into the fence. The two of them climbed quickly, threw themselves over the top of the fence, scaled down, and hid behind a shipping container. They made their way around the perimeter, dashing from container to container, until they reached the waterline. Finally, they sprinted in the open, exposed to the orange flood lights and the security cameras, to bay eight.</p>

<p>The autoship docked there was the Maersk Ohio 903E. On Google Jakob had found out that it was 292 meters long and 32 meters wide, but from where they crouched at the water’s edge, it seemed much larger. It towered above Anna and Jakob. The blue steel hull curved upward toward the deck, which was little more than a few strips of metal topping the walls of the holds, container-sized storage cells six layers deep. Around the perimeter of the ship and along the strips of deck were chain-link fences securing up to three more layers of containers. But these dimensions were unremarkable. Manned container ships of the same size had gone out of practicality some ten years before. Crews had been replaced by the half-dome of black glass at the fore of the ship, housing its array of cameras and LIDAR sensors. There was no bridge and no wheelhouse. Somewhere in the long sleek belly of the ship were two blocks of computers, and Jakob could feel them churning away, perhaps considering the two forms crouched by the lapping waves, scarcely breathing, craning their necks to peer up at the distant fences. He wondered if it could sense their yearning, or rather their yearnings, or the distance between them. He felt a chill. The port was lit up but the ship was not. It was a dead thing, a hulking mindless thing, rocking up and down with the coming swells and fading from fore to aft into darkness.</p>

<p>Anna moved without speaking. Twenty meters from the fore of the ship, a series of metal rungs studded the hull. It was just within reach when Anna stopped at the point of the pier. They were out of reach of the flood lights, and they waited thirty seconds for their eyes to adjust. Jakob eyed the two-meter gap between the pier and the closest rung. It felt a long way given that the ship bobbed and that the temperature of the water was fifty-three degrees. Anna hesitated only a moment. Then she jumped and was across and climbed. Jakob took one halting step forward and jumped. The moment of weightlessness was infinite. He felt that his backpack was full of stones. He was falling downward more than moving forward. But he caught the icy metal of the lowest rung, and though his body tipped backward with the weight of the pack he did not fall. He looked up at the soles of Anna’s boots and climbed.
They climbed up the side of the ship, and at the level of the deck they pressed themselves against the fence and tried the gate, which was padlocked. This was expected, and with no pleasant surprise forthcoming, they scaled the fence. It took two minutes to climb from sea level to the top. The feeling went from Jakob’s hands. The hood of his jacket fell back and exposed his face to a sudden cold wind. His armpits were slicked with sweat.</p>

<p>At the top Jakob made the mistake of looking down and was dizzied. He felt himself lurch from side to side with the rocking of the ship. He felt the morbid curiosity in his body, the urge to tip into the void and plummet and break against the edge of that spit of concrete. He felt, too, the body’s disbelief, the resistance to its own death image. For a moment he was filled with courage and he sat straddling the fence. He breathed heavily and peered into the water, then at the deck on the other side of the fence, visible between the columns of containers. He saw Anna’s shadow, already halfway down the fence, and the courage drained. He settled into the animal assurance of his own invincibility, the impossibility of the fall, and swung his leg over to descend.</p>

<h3 id="scraps-in-progress">scraps in progress</h3>

<p>Sometimes I write down little moments or images I want to fit into the piece later. Here are a couple I had planned for this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To the east the sky is pale blue. The rest is indigo tumbling into black. Not even the mournful ribbon of a plane passing high over. Not even a cloud except for those firm billowing columns on the horizon. Not even a sound except for the breaking of the waves off of the bow and the deep rumbling of the engine.
Jakob sits with his feet dangling off of the column of containers. He hooks a foot into the chain-link fence. He imagines what he would look like to a bird, to a plane, to a satellite, to the moon. A gray dot on a blue sheet.
An image he has long forgotten comes, unbidden, to mind. His middle school science teacher on the day of his graduation. The empty classroom, Jakob’s hand on the door handle. Mrs. O saying with her knowing smile, “And hey. Have a good life.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“It’s the hardest thing to find someplace to be really alone in the world.”
“Then what am I doing here?”
“Well you don’t want to be alone, not really. You want to sit on the edge of it and pull back at the last second.”</p>
  </li>
</ul>
