    <p>In autumn the woman walked down the long and overcast road and stepped in her sneakers through the banks of wrinkled leaves. The sky was pregnant and orange. She stepped through the leaves and onto the lawn of the old house. The patchy lawn with its hateful bald spots. The wilted grass and the overgrown weeds at the edges of the house. The house-shaped house with its peeling siding and hopeful white paint job. As if anything could have grown there. The dead windows staring out at her. The door, solid as ever.</p>

<p>She turned to look. There was no one in the street behind her. No one as far as she could see. She bent and picked up a stone from the lawn. She hurled it at the door. She grunted as she did so. The stone made a little sound as it impacted and then skittered away. The sound was too little.</p>

<p>She found another stone and threw it at one of the eyes. It shattered just as she’d dreamed it would. The shattering had the weight of everything. She tossed back her head and laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p>She found another rock and hurled it at the other eye. It too shattered, and she treasured the tinkling of the shards. But when it was done, she found the dead eyes still watched her, maybe even more deeply without the glasses. They made her uneasy. And still there was the door. Solid as ever.</p>

<p>She came up the walk, watching the door. It didn’t flinch. She came up the stairs. It dwarfed her. Hateful thing. She stepped back and clenched her hands. They were sweaty. It really was a big door. She took a deep breath.</p>

<p>“I hate you,” she said, and with a running step forward she kicked the door. It didn’t give. Her toes hurt, but it was a good hurt.</p>

<p>“Fuck!” she said.</p>

<p>She kicked it again. She struck it with the flat of her hand, then punched it, and punched it again, and again, bringing her raw knuckles down on the wood like a gavel. It shuddered in its frame but gave nothing more.</p>

<p>She stepped back when the skin on her knuckles was scraped red. She stepped away and the door stood. But she smiled at it. She backed down the steps and turned and went back down the overcast road. She went to her car and took the necessities from her trunk.
On the walk back there was no one out, but she didn’t care anymore. Her steps were strong and fluid. She allowed herself to bounce as she walked. The trees nodded at her and she smiled back at them.</p>

<p>She came to the lawn and crossed it and went to the dead window on the left. She peered in and saw the old and dusty clutter. Still a couch in there, bursting and dried up like a prune. She aimed for the couch, but it was hard to aim and she settled for splashing it over the walls and on the floorboards. When the canister was nearly empty she went up to the door and poured the rest through the gap underneath. Then she stepped away and backed off to the street. From there it didn’t look any different. It looked just as capable as ever. She laughed and went to the window and flicked a lit match at the couch. The smell was gorgeous.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts">thoughts</h3>

<p>For a freewrite, this is a cool piece. (I guess I use the term ‘freewrite’ more liberally than I should – generally a freewrite is a fully unedited, stream-of-consciousness piece. You don’t let your fingers stop typing, you don’t correct typos, etc. I posted an <a href="/2020/11/28/black-room.html">actual freewrite here</a> if you’re curious what that looks like. This was a freewrite only in the sense that I had no plan, I just started writing, but I allowed myself to pause and think briefly – which, granted, defeats the whole purpose of a freewrite.)</p>

<p>I think while I was writing this I wanted to try to give this inanimate object of the house a character. But I ended up reflecting most of that character onto the protagonist – the weird descriptions become her descriptions, which reveal her disturbed mental state. “House-shaped house” is funny to me; I know what I was trying to do there but I don’t know if it worked. I think “as if anything could have grown there” is a pretty dark and intriguing note. Once I wrote that, I figured this could be a piece about someone who’s been driven to extremes by past trauma, and I played into it. That’s where “the trees nodded at her” came from, for example.</p>

<p>I also like “bringing her raw knuckles down on the wood like a gavel.” Ocean Vuong has a <a href="https://twitter.com/_abelisaurus_/status/1330057648801198081?lang=en">brilliant series of Instagram stories on metaphor</a> in which he argues that metaphor has to work on a sensory level and a logical level. A metaphor that exists just because the writer connected two unlike images and went, “That’s pretty cool, I should toss that in,” is a poor metaphor. Even if the images are connected and interesting. The movement from the first image to the second image has to also reveal something about the first image and imbue it with new meaning / logic. In communicating that the protagonist has suffered some injustice and is now righting it, the gavel image does this.</p>
