For those pieces I just mean that I didn’t self-censor or revise; I had an image or an idea and ran with it. But I allowed myself to pause and think about what to say next. A real freewrite is a stream-of-consciousness piece of writing. Your only task is not to lift up the pen or stop typing – to create a continuous flow of words. Generally these are timed. The point is to get something on the page and to get into a focused state of mind to do other writing, but also to clear out all of the easy go-to phrases / images you might have in mind. Your fingers are supposed to outpace your brain, so that you discover truly novel trains of thought. You don’t correct typos or go backward. Anyway, here’s a real freewrite I found on my desktop.</h5>

<p>I straighten myself up and look at mysel fand look into the yes and disappear into those pupils, sucked in by self interest. More like interested in self. Concerned with it. Not concerned in the sense of worry but in the sense of caught up. I get sucked into that pupil and what is inside is what is here – the inner monologue. I am already here, on a stage in a giant infinite black room. And there is a spotlight from somewhere it comes blasting in from the aether and through te dusty blackness to alight on my face. And i stand looking up into it watching the dust motes dance through the beam. I start dancing across the black infinite room. The water layer over the floor the black tile floor just splashing as i dance and land and up and go down again. The feeling of the cold water over my feet, i jump and jump and try to jump and fly out of the water so i dont land in that cold water again ;; tererribly cold ;; so cold it hurts and i can’t feel my toes; but it is okay eventually i am tired and stop with ragged breath to bend over and put my hands on my knees and sit looking at my toes and watching as they go purple with the cold and not feeling thme anymore. Sure i have frostbite but i settle into a squat ; ;; my weight on the heels lifted up from the water and resting with my elbows on my knees and my hands clasped between them just looking out at the blackness beyond the spotlight. Lokoing up at the spotlight and hpoping it dowes not get a mind of its own and continues to decide to fllow me ;; otherwise i would be beholden to it and i would chase it until my legs gave out and then i would sit in the infinite drakness watching that little beam recede until i could no longer see it and in that final moment wondering whether i still could ;; whether that was an afterimage or really the thing – like when you watch a plane until you can’t see it anymore and the precise moment when your imagination takes over and the physical reality is too far is not discernable. I wait there for the spotlight to move. Watching the outer edge of that circle. daring it to move. It does not move and so i stay there panting. Then i decide i must move again. I stand. But my legs are hurting terribly and my feet are cold. so i get on my hands and knees and crawl. And this is a poor idea because now my knees and shins and hands are cold – soo cold. but i keep crawling because to not carwl would be to die. I keep crawling forever. I crawl forever and ever. I count the paces – from one to ten. Then i begin again. Ten at a time. Ten at a time. I do not know how many times i have counted to ten. My palms are weary – my knees ache from putting them down too hard onto the black tile. I scrape my knee a bit. I scrape it again. The hands the palms are red and raw. I am tired. I count to ten again. I slow down. I need to rest, but just for a little bit. I would like to lie on my side so i do. The right side of my body is wet now. My hair dips into the water. I feel the capillary action pull the water up between the strands of hair and toward my scalp. The feeling is intoxicating. I give a little involuntary smile as the water creeps up toward my exposed scalp. My emple is bathed in water. My ear too touches the surface of the water. Resting on my shoulder. The arm laid out and extended toward the outer edge of the circle of light. It is such a dramatic gesture i can’t help but laugh a bit. Even in this situation, too dramatic. My legs too, one sprawled out straight and the other curled underneath it. I am like some fallen swan or angel in a renaissance painting. but i understand them now. I undrestand these fallen angels for why they lie like this, why the michelangelos have found them so theatrically laid out. It is comfortable. It is a comfortable position of no resistance. I am barely even living when i do this; barely even needing to exist to maintain this posture. I can simply let the water lap at my face. I can simply let the dust motes dance back and forth across the infinite beam. I can simply imagine the wolves around the edge of the circle waiting for me to expire so they can feed on my innards and spill that red blood into the pooling water and dilute the hemoglobin infinitely to one.</p>
