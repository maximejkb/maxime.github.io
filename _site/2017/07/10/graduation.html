    <p>I went to three high school graduations before my own. I went to my brother Julien’s. I went to my sister Aya’s. I went to my sister Camille’s. Each time, it felt like the world had opened up in front of them. They wore red robes and sat in the amphitheater in front of the elm trees and the flag poles that held up the class flags from years past. They sat and the sky was blue and the principal said many pretty things that were the same each year and my dad ran up the aisle to kneel at the front and take a photo when my sibling took their diploma. I thought, “That’ll be me one day.” And then it was.</p>

<hr />

<p>I rehearsed graduation twice that day, and stood in line in the school gymnasium, and was sweaty and hot in the morning and cold in the afternoon when the rain came in. It didn’t rain at graduation. The rain stopped an hour before.</p>

<p>When graduation started I stood in the grass field behind the amphitheater with the rest of my class. The end of the field was a hill that rose up to meet the top of the amphitheater where the elms grew. There was a crowd behind the hill: I could hear them though I couldn’t see them. I knew my parents were in the crowd. I knew where they would be sitting, dead center on the left side of the aisle. I turned to my friend Dylan, who was beside me. I said, “Is this really happening?”</p>

<p>He blinked at me. He said, “Yeah, I guess so.”</p>

<p>I said, “This is really happening. This is the day we graduate high school.”</p>

<p>The wind swept through the ranks of my classmates. I shivered and adjusted my mortarboard. Down the row and along the rows in front of me I could see people fussing with their tassels.</p>

<p>Dylan grinned. “This is the day we’ll remember for the rest of our lives. Soak it up.”</p>

<p>“It’s glorious,” I said.</p>

<p>We waited for five more minutes until the principal concluded his opening remarks. We heard them faintly from over the hill. Then, without warning, the vice-principal on the right side of the front row raised her hands in the air. We all perked up. She gave the signal. The first row ran up the hill and stood at the top. The crowd beyond cheered, and we did as well, and the row split into halves and the halves turned to face each other and each pair of students shook hands and walked down into the amphitheater. We advanced a row.</p>

<p>One by one, five rows stood at the top of the amphitheater and split and shook hands and walked down. Then I stood at the front and the vice-principal raised her hands and we ran, Dylan and I, and stood at the top of the amphitheater.</p>

<p>The crowd looked close and small. It had felt enormous and claustrophobic when I had sat in it, and my siblings had seemed to be miles away, just red dots. The sky was gray and the concrete under my shoe soles was wet. I stood for a second and turned, and shook a hand, and walked down and took my seat behind a potted fern. I sat in stunned silence as the principal said the same things as he had the years before. He called out names and students rose one by one and walked down the aisle and took their diplomas. Friends of each graduate hooted and clapped as the names were called, and sometimes people in the crowd cheered as well. You could tell who was well-liked and who was not by the applause at their name, and I was grateful when I was called and my friends clapped and they were loud. I didn’t want my parents to hear dead silence at my name. There were always students whose names were met with dead silence. In our class it was [redacted]<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. I remember thinking, “At least it wasn’t me.”</p>

<p>Then it was over. I took photos with my friends: photos from the day I graduated high school. I took photos with my parents. I received my real diploma from the school cafeteria, since the diplomas they handed out on stage were fakes – or rather they were just the empty leather folders for the diplomas. I congratulated my friends, one by one. My mom found me by the cafeteria and said, “We should go before the traffic gets too bad.” We walked across the parking lot and I took off my robes and my mortarboard and put them in the trunk of the car, and we left just as the crowd began to head our way.</p>

<hr />

<p>My parents took me out for dinner, and after dinner I said goodbye to them and walked back to the high school, where my friend Daniel was to pick me up. All of my friends and I were going somewhere, maybe to the beach, to spend the night together.
When I reached the high school, the sun dipped behind Mount Tam. The sky went purple to the east. I stuck my hands in my pockets and walked very slowly toward the field, where my parents had sat, where I had sat three times to watch my siblings walk. The chairs had been folded by the custodial staff and left in stacks here and there around the field like hay bales. The class flags had been left up, and I watched them. I saw the flag from my brother’s graduating year, five years before my own. I saw the flag from my sister’s year, and my other sister’s year. I saw my own flag in the middle, flapping in the wind, and thought of all the flags that would come after.</p>

<p>I was grateful for the silence. It was so quiet I could hear the cars on the highway in the distance and the passenger jet somewhere above the low clouds.</p>

<p>I walked across the field and up the amphitheater steps. I stopped behind the fern, where I had been sitting. I stood there and looked out at the field and said quietly, “I graduated high school today. Here. I graduated high school.”</p>

<p>I wanted the words to ripple out from my mouth and make something happen, whatever was supposed to. But everything stayed as it was.</p>

<p>It was in the ensuing silence that I saw the front door to the far-off school building open. A man with a long beard, wearing a flannel shirt and jeans, stepped out. He put his tote bag down and turned and locked the door behind him and began to walk toward the parking lot. I watched and didn’t say anything. As he turned right on the path to the parking lot, he saw me. He stopped and raised a hand.</p>

<p>It was Mr. [Fakename]<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, who had taught me English in my freshman and junior years.</p>

<p>I waved back. He raised a finger – one second – and walked toward me across the field. When he reached the amphitheater, he scraped his boots on the concrete to remove the mud. He looked up at me and said, “Mind if I join?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said.</p>

<p>He climbed the steps and sat beside me, and was silent for a moment, looking out across the field toward the school. He said, “What are you doing?”</p>

<p>“I’m waiting for Daniel,” I said.</p>

<p>“Are you going somewhere?”</p>

<p>“We’re going to the beach, I think.”</p>

<p>“The beach? At this hour?”</p>

<p>“We’re not going to swim,” I said. “I don’t think we’re going to swim.”</p>

<p>“Okay.” He looked at me for a long moment.</p>

<p>He knew me well enough. He was one of the good ones, one of the teachers I’d miss, though his classes hadn’t been particularly hard or useful. Most days he sat at the front of the room at his desk. He always began his classes with the words, “Students, take out your notebooks.” But he never taught us anything we could write in a notebook. He disregarded the texts he assigned us to read for most of class, and instead told us stories about his youth. About the time he’d dropped acid with his friends and climbed the fence to his high school swimming pool and thrown deck chairs in the deep end. About the time he’d driven to the Golden Gate Bridge and lowered himself onto the suicide nets with his friends. They lay there screaming into the open drop and at the passing ships making their ways out to the far horizon, so hopped up on fear that when they got back to the car he cried. About the lazy afternoons he’d spent in Mill Valley, just walking up and down the downtown streets looking for a thing to do. He told us stories that might have gotten him fired. He never asked us to keep them secret, and in fact many of them circulated. But he did it to make us laugh. He was happy when we laughed, and he laughed with us. His laugh was loud, and he threw his head back and squeezed his eyes shut behind his glasses with such fierce happiness that I couldn’t help but smile. No other teacher ever made me smile like he did. He made silly faces and made fun of himself and sometimes said things that made us uncomfortable, just to get a kick out of seeing us squirm.</p>

<p>He could be serious, as well. He could be silent and grave. He was serious when he told us about his son. Of the love he’d had for him. Of the things he would have done to keep him breathing. Of the nights he’d cried because there was nothing he could do to stop the illness. Of holding a nine-year-old boy in his arms and thinking, “He still feels alive.” I only saw him cry once, and it was when he said the word “alive.” He pinched the bridge of his nose under his glasses and shut his eyes and took a shaky breath. A girl sitting by the door stood and went to him and held his hand. We were old enough to know that old men and teachers were only human, but he told me, in many ways, for the first time.</p>

<p>When he looked at me in the amphitheater that day I graduated high school, I remembered him crying. He looked just as sad, for a moment, as he had that day in class. I laughed, because I was uncomfortable with this sadness. I said, “What?”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “You looked very grown up just then. Sitting up here all alone. I remember when you were a freshman. You were always messing around. But you looked very grown up.”</p>

<p>“That’s not a bad thing.”</p>

<p>“No.” He looked at me without expectation. I knew I could take the conversation in one of two ways: I could say something insightful, philosophical, and even prompt him for a few words of advice. Or I could laugh it off, and he would be happy with this just the same, and would keep to himself whatever he’d thought of to say.</p>

<p>In the end I said, “Aren’t we supposed to grow up?”</p>

<p>Mr. [Fakename] played with the tip of his beard. He said, “You’re supposed to grow up, that’s true. But you’ll grow up whether or not you try to.” I didn’t know what to say to this, and after a pause he shrugged. He seemed to know I wanted more. It would have made me feel safe to have him and talk and talk, and all I would have had to do was listen. But he didn’t continue. He only asked, “What were you thinking about, before I came?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I said.</p>

<p>A car pulled in to the parking lot. Its headlight cones cut across the darkened lot, and I could see how empty that lot was. I had never seen the school parking lot so empty. “I guess I was trying to make myself feel it. The fact that I’ve graduated.”
He nodded. “Did you feel it?”</p>

<p>“Not really,” I said.</p>

<p>The car stopped. It was a brown Volvo, and I could see Daniel in the driver’s seat. Mr. [Fakename] followed my gaze and said, “Is that you?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” I said.</p>

<p>He nodded. We stood and walked down the steps and across the field. He was quiet, and I got the sense that he was thinking very hard and that there were many things he wanted to say now. Daniel waved through the windshield. I waved back. I realized that I wanted to slow down so Mr. [Fakename] could say what he had to say, but I didn’t want to let on. I matched his long-legged pace. We walked too fast, and reached the curb without saying anything.</p>

<p>At the curb I turned and said, “Thanks for sitting with me.”</p>

<p>Mr. [Fakename] stretched out his hand and I shook it. He seemed to realize that I was about to get in the car and drive away, maybe for a very long time. He said, “Come back to visit sometime.”</p>

<p>“I will.” I put my hand on the car door’s handle.</p>

<p>All at once, as if he’d been chewing on it for a long time, Mr. [Fakename] said, “And… have a good life.”</p>

<p>He smiled in that open and knowing way he had, but also in a sheepish way, as if he wasn’t quite sure whether he was being dramatic or not. Whether it was the kind of thing a person could say outside of a movie.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” I said. It was all I could think of to say. There was an awkward moment, and then I tugged on the door handle and Mr. [Fakename] stepped off the curb and set off across the parking lot. I looked after him, hoping that he didn’t feel silly, hoping that I’d also said in a way he could hear, “I didn’t think it was weird.”</p>

<hr />

<p>That night we drove out to Fort Baker and parked at the end of the road. There was a pier there, Moore Road Pier, and from the pier to the Marin side of the Golden Gate Bridge it was only half a mile. The steel trusses of the bridge overhead looked mythical, like they could only have been built by giants.</p>

<p>There were six of us and two cars – Daniel’s Volvo and Will’s Land Rover. It was a cold night, with the fog coming in through the gap in land, obscuring the bridge. I thought about all that fog: fog stretching out to the horizon, out to the Farallon Islands, sweeping up and over us and to San Francisco beyond.</p>

<p>We pulled out blankets from the back of Will’s car and set out along the pier. At the end of the pier was a square platform. We were far enough from shore that we seemed to be adrift, with the copper orange lights of the bridge high above and coloring the fog.</p>

<p>I sat on a blackened mooring bollard and watched the waves come in. They were smooth, like long sine waves. They didn’t break the mirror of the water; they were gentle hills rolling under all of that surface tension. I thought, “Today something big happened to me.” I tried to feel that it was true, but I couldn’t.</p>

<p>Daniel came and sat beside me. He pulled off his glasses and rubbed them on his shirt. “How’s it going?” he said.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I said. I watched the waves roll by. I couldn’t see the shore through the fog and the waves were too quiet for me to hear them break. It was as if they went on forever. For some reason, when I looked far to my right to where they faded unbroken into gray, I felt sad. I felt that I could put it into words, too, for the first time that day, and I tried. “Just. A lot is going to change. Everyone talks about their high school years. The people they were in high school. The people they were with when they were young, and how it all changed. I didn’t like high school all that much. But I don’t want you guys, and all the things we did together, to become something someone else did a long time ago.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t have to change.”</p>

<p>“I guess not. It’s just. Everything up until now was mandatory. We lived at home, we did what our parents said, we went to school. Now we can do anything. And if we’re happy in twenty years or bitter, there’s no one to blame but ourselves. And it all starts here.”</p>

<p>Daniel nodded. A container ship glided into view, tall as a building and ghostly at the edge of obscurity. Daniel didn’t answer for a long time, which I liked. I didn’t try to speak, because I knew he was quiet because he was thinking. He turned to me in the end and said, “Isn’t that kind of exciting?” He looked at me and was serious. I nodded, then smiled, and he smiled too. “It all starts here,” he said.</p>

<p>We watched the ship slide under the bridge and into the fog. I knew that if the fog were not there I would see the sheet of ocean and the moonlit sky and the orange lights of container ships in a long line to the horizon. <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

      <p>Thoughts: I still find some of the imagery really beautiful in its starkness… At the time I guess I accessed “depth” mostly through sadness. The moments I tended to write about were the moments that made me internalize some hollowness or emptiness I’d identified in my life. Which is not to say I was a sad person, I think I just had yet to realize how much depth can be about beauty; I was always able to see the hollowness of thing X, but not the fullness X used to have or the adjacent fullness of some other thing Y that made me cognizant of the hollowness of X. Maybe that’s because I engaged with life mostly by thinking about it – by being introspective – but not by actually doing cool things. On a technical level, I get the sense that the piece was trying too hard to make me feel something. It was insistent but too transparent for its own good, which is to say that a lot of the ideas were (extremely) on the nose… All in all, I don’t hate it, but I also don’t love the person it reveals. But that’s who I was, and I know where I was coming from, so I accept it. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
