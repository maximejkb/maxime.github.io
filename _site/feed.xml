I guess in some ill-lit cave at the base of my brain stem, I do, but the human in me is tired and just wants to sleep. But I give a little smile and say Yes, because she is fragile in her offering, because she is timid and the forthrightness is difficult for her. If I told her No it would devastate her. She says Okay. She starts to fumble with the top button of her shirt – she is stiff with nerves, performing this part of a girl who knows what to do here. I laugh and put a hand on her hip and pull her toward where I am seated on the edge of the bed. I say Let me. She looks down at me and her hair falls into my eyes. She laughs now and arranges her hair over her shoulder. I reach for her top button and ask Can I? And she nods. I unbutton her shirt and she shrugs it off and looks at me as if for approval. I slide my hands over her thin shoulders and down to her waist and pretend to be more overcome with desire than I am. Normally I would not have to pretend, but at the moment I want to sleep. I put my head against her stomach and close my eyes. She runs her fingers through my hair and this does give me a rush of pleasure – I have always liked the feeling of someone’s nails tracing over my scalp. It gives me chills. I hook my fingers on the inside of her waistband and make my way around to the front and ask Can I, and she says Yes, and I unbutton her jeans and take them down without opening my eyes. I really am tired. I pull her down and onto my lap and hold onto her, and she holds my head but there is the lingering question of What now? I don’t know how to tell her I just want to sleep. After a minute she says We can just sleep, and I feel myself flush with gratitude. I laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read me, huh, I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can read you, she says softly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fall back into bed and pull her alongside me. She throws a leg over my legs and puts her head on my chest, a hand on the side of my neck. I close my eyes. She looks up at me every once in a while, maybe to check if I am still awake. I drift a bit into the semi-consciousness which is often the closest I can get to sleep with someone else in my bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you still think about her? she asks, so quietly that at first I think I am dreaming. I don’t open my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I say. Yeah. Is that okay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you thinking about her now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to say, I say. I feel her head move against my chest as she nods. She is quiet. I drift again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you wish she was here instead of me? she whispers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city quiets, pressed up in its dim blue light against the blinds. As if to listen in. A train passing under the distant highway overpass groans, and the cars race down Telegraph, their tires hissing on the pavement. Somewhere, an ambulance or fire truck wails and I think it is odd that I enjoy that sound, though it announces emergency, because from far off it reminds me of the city, becomes ambient, loses urgency. I am weightless in the event horizon of sleep. I hear that whisper over and over. It takes my breath away. By the time I realize I have not answered, her breathing is slow and deep and she twitches in the involuntary way of someone dreaming. I approach the asymptote of sleep, thinking of how fucked up I am over her, the other her, hearing that whisper over and over again: Do you wish she was here instead of me?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">something from a freewrite</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">a mad rush</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/12/mad-rush.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a mad rush" /><published>2020-12-12T21:15:39-08:00</published><updated>2020-12-12T21:15:39-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/12/12/mad-rush</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/12/mad-rush.html">&lt;p&gt;In some ways these past four years have been a mad rush. Every day so urgent and full that I barely had time to look around and register. Most of the time spent rushing to class, then to a library, then home to finish some problem set or class project before a midnight deadline. Stringing these deadlines together for four years and then wondering where the time went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other ways these years have been a slow burn. The nights spent with friends, singing and playing guitar (not me, someone else). The nights spent walking down Telegraph with people I love. These nights were not as common as the problem sets but they were brilliant and shine in my memory so that everything in between fades away. The afternoons in libraries with friends by my side, working in silent camaraderie. These years have been full of love, I realize now. Full to the brim with it, and I am endlessly grateful for that. I am grateful to have met people different from me, outgoing and warm – people who attracted other good people to them so that I could, in turn, become friends with them. People who took this achievement-hungry freshman and showed him the joys of sunning yourself on a towel in a park and strumming a guitar, of singing a song from a musical, of piling onto a couch to watch a movie. And who sacrificed none of their ambition in order to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    some of the people who've showed me the way
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am scared that I will move away from this place and be surrounded by career hounds. That I will lose whatever spark these people have lit in me, that I will lose this newfound looseness, the shine that comes from reflecting them. I have, since childhood, chased the approval of my parents, the achievement of my older siblings, the admiration of my peers. Sometimes at the cost of my own satisfaction. I want to be surrounded by people who beat back that ambition, which can be dark and insidious in its profundity, and who keep the light and artistic and spontaneous in me alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I recognize, too, that part of the beauty of these people I now know is that they require no fodder to be who they are. They build it up within themselves. They have some to spare, so much so that they built it up in me. If I want to remain this way it is in my hands to keep my own fires alive. And I will try to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">a short reflection about the friends i've made at berkeley</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">birds</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/10/berkeley-birds.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="birds" /><published>2020-12-10T21:15:39-08:00</published><updated>2020-12-10T21:15:39-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/12/10/berkeley-birds</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/10/berkeley-birds.html">&lt;p&gt;The barred world through the slats of my blinds. The gray sky; the black tree against the gray sky. The light filtering in green-tinted around the window frame. The rumbling of the construction trucks, the rumbling of their engines. The soft music coming in through my headphones; now the groaning of pistons on a dump truck and the clatter of its load coming down on the packed earth of that construction site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder where the birds go when they fly up from the hanging tree across the parking lot; I wonder what it looks like to them, Berkeley. They flit upward and hang over Telegraph, watching the students march up and down the sidewalks, watching the cars whip through intersections and bank close to the sidewalks on turns, almost bowling people over. They watch the homeless men raise fists at passersby and the spitting people in the park throw stones and spray each other with the water hoses. They watch the police stop by some alley and peer in, find some misbegotten wanderer down and out on their luck and haul them into the back of the squad car like poachers. They watch the hungry dogs across from the hotel construction site loping down the alley by Berkeley Thai House, sniffing for scraps. The wind blows them back and they flap to stay in place. From up here the city is a quiet whirlwind. They are too far up to hear the chattering of the teeth and the gnawing on bones and the hollering of the homeless men and the honking of cars and the scrape of the orange-suited Telegraph Ambassadors’ brooms on the unwashed pavement. It must be beautiful in its quickness. Startling and stark in the way that a sunset is. Violent, too. Horribly so. But in a quiet way that they probably can’t understand. The struggle for life and will and achievement – the little battles playing out in every person’s mind as they wait, knees jittering, for their coffee, or push past the slow walkers on the sidewalk, or cross the street a few seconds before the light changes just to get home a little bit faster. Probably they wonder what the big deal is; probably they wonder what the hurry is; probably they wonder why we are leaving our scraps on the pavement. They wing down and alight on an electric wire or the edge of some apartment building roof to watch more closely. Now they can hear the grim focus.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">a freewrite about the birds in berkeley</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">after school</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/09/after-school.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="after school" /><published>2020-12-09T21:15:39-08:00</published><updated>2020-12-09T21:15:39-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/12/09/after-school</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/09/after-school.html">&lt;p&gt;Been thinking a little about who I am when the dust settles and school is over. I’m not sure I know. School has been all-encompassing for the past three and a half years. Becoming a new person. Workload, competition, fundamental difficulty – crashing over me like ocean waves. First few months, trying to fight it off and failing. Finding it better to dive in head first. To submerge myself. It’s easier to adjust to it if you don’t fight it. There’s a beauty in that kind of full immersion, submission, giving in to. There’s a loss there, too – a loss of self. Losing who you are to what you do. A price I was willing to pay during my time here. And now, shaking myself off and lifting my head, I wonder who I am. I guess I couldn’t lose the writing. That part of me was too precious to give up and too painful to abandon. Kept coming back to it, kept picking it up where I dropped it, kept thinking, “It can’t be worth it if I have to lose this.” Started taking classes in the department so that I could hold on to it even while submerged – made it a series of deadlines and assignments like everything else. That kept me writing, and disguised it as pragmatism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of this incalculability sometimes the only answer is to guess. Sometimes another answer is to freeze, paralyzed by choice, and let the decision make itself one way or another. And so it goes, and so we go – deciding, imperfectly, sub-optimally, and seeing where it takes us. The more big decisions I make the more I realize how arbitrary these decisions are. You can bite your fingernails down to the quick and make as many lists of pros and cons as you like, but sometimes these choices defy calculation, or butterfly-effect into too many what-ifs to tally. In these cases you can make locally optimal decisions using interest or gut feeling as a heuristic, and gather more data. But you can’t know for certain, or even with high probability. And that lack of certainty scares the hell out of me. I guess I used to think that people made such big decisions on solid foundation, that they knew what would happen when they went left instead of right. I guess that’s the impression people give when they talk about their lives in retrospect. But so much of that, I see now, is just making it fit. Is doing the human thing of finding a way. Maybe they should have gone right, and it would have opened a world of possibility. But instead they went left and made the most of it, and twenty years later they look back and say, “I always knew I should have gone left. That’s where the growth was, you see.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">thinking about big decisions again</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">moments when things felt still</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/08/moments-love.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="moments when things felt still" /><published>2020-12-08T21:15:39-08:00</published><updated>2020-12-08T21:15:39-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/12/08/moments-love</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/08/moments-love.html">&lt;p&gt;In the background, the soft piano, and, “Let me know. Do I still got time to grow?” The car banking at eighty around the wide corner. James nodding his head, moving with the beat, singing softly. The wall of trees clearing on the right side of the highway, stretching thin to reveal the wide bowl of the South Bay. Little lights of houses rising slowly up the far foothills, the mountain beyond. All those parked cars; gas stations with glowing blue and red signs; roads laid bare; shingle roofs and childhood bedrooms; electric wires; crescendoing piano – “Seems like streelights, glowing, happen to…” – I think of her. I wonder where she lives, whether I could drive to it. Probably she is within fifteen minutes of me. That I could drive so little and step out onto some suburban sidewalk and wait there for her to open a front door and step onto the stoop and we would be there, a few feet apart, in the falling night. It makes me ache like crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the girls asks us whether when it comes to love we’re, “Like, simpy, like, ‘Oh, let me take you to dinner,’” or whether it’s more like – she makes a smacking motion with the palms of her hands. She makes a face when she explains the first option, as if describing a squashed bug. James laughs and says nervously, “I guess more like the second.” They turn to me and I say, “In between.” But the moment I say it I wonder why I’m genuflecting to the implied preference, why I’m agreeing with this idea that it’s weak to care about someone. I correct myself. “Probably more like the first, though,” I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, okay. I respect that, I respect that,” she says. Her face registers some note of surprise. I wonder whether she was only trying to preempt the way she imagined we thought of love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth is, sunsets remind me of you. The beach reminds me of you. Crossing the Bay Bridge reminds me of you; walking down Channing; walking past the Campanile; walking past BAMPFA; this city is nothing but the afterimage of you; I’m walking around still squinting at your light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the Polaroid of you out of my wallet and put it on my wall. I don’t know what that means. I see it more often than before, but I don’t carry it with me where I go. Maybe that’s moving on or maybe it’s hanging on. I guess I’ll only know in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I want to write a poem but I don’t know how to write poetry. So I’ll write it like this instead. If fate put me in a house with you forever I think I would be happy. If I woke up one day and blinked and said Where am I and turned over to see you, and you said Home, I would be happy. If we went to the kitchen that morning and every morning after and made coffee and worked quietly, sipping our coffee, you at the dining table and me at the desk, I would be happy; if you looked up without warning and rolled your eyes and complained about the guy who talks to much in your meetings; if I complained to you about not being able to find the right word – it’s like ___, but not quite – I would be happy. If one of us said Hey, are you hungry, and dug through the fridge to find the leftovers in tupperwares and nuke them in the microwave for a few minutes; if every once in a while I got up to bother you and read your papers over your shoulder until you said Don’t you have things to do; and I held you close for a moment and you closed your eyes before saying Okay, okay, and shooing me away; and you came over every once in a while to ask me about a line edit on one of your drafts; and I caught myself staring at you and sometimes you looked up and saw me looking and gave your little lopsided smile – I would be happy. Endlessly happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all the hours we spent together, sitting by side by side and working, I never got a second of work done. All I did was sit there thinking about her, wondering when it was next acceptable to bother her, wondering when she would be done with her work, wondering whether I could be doing mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Tell me the truth: when did you know you were ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Why did you say Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Because at the time I needed a green card, and it just made more sense with your brother on the way. And plus, we’d been dating for so long at that point that it didn’t feel like such a big deal. It was just, like, making things official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You already thought you’d be with him forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Not forever, but I thought for a long time. And then when I got pregnant, I thought, well, he’d better stick around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;And this was one way to make sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You could say that… No, I’m just being funny, but that’s not why I did it. I think I knew he wasn’t that kind of person, who got scared of things like that. I didn’t need to anchor him to me. It was just sort of… I was pregnant. We were having a kid together. So, we were going to see it through. And so it was obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Sometimes love is like that. Sometimes it’s obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah… And sometimes it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Sometimes it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What do you do when it’s not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I wish I had a simple answer for you… But, you know, it’s not like you get some magic rulebook as you get older. Some things you can make rules for, but love is messy. And irrational. Sometimes it’s more about the feeling than what’s logical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You’re sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Why are you sad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t know… Just… Inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay, inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah… Like… I feel like I’m losing someone I was maybe meant to be with… Not that I believe there’s one person you’re meant to be with. But. I can’t explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You love her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I love her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yes… I can see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No you can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yes, really – come on, now, you think a mother can’t see when her kid is in love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Well, I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You know, sometimes… Sometimes it’s obvious.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">some moments compiled from different pieces when i couldn't think about anyone else</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">acid</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/01/acid.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="acid" /><published>2020-12-01T21:15:39-08:00</published><updated>2020-12-01T21:15:39-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/12/01/acid</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/01/acid.html">&lt;p&gt;SCENE 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;An auditorium – on stage, a panel of professors chairing a research symposium. Fred, a presenting undergraduate, has just finished his presentation. He shakes a few professors’ hands. He steps off stage and takes his seat in the audience. He turns to his friend Dylan with his mouth agape. His mic is still on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Are you seeing this shit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;DYLAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;DYLAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Ohhh, shit! You’re tripping sack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Laughter in the audience. Confusion among the panelists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t know how the fuck I made it through that. That tab is kicking my ass up and down the astral plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The professors catch on. They try to get Fred’s attention but he doesn’t notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;DYLAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You seeing things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;My mind is a speaker and God’s on aux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;DYLAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t even know what that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m riding a dreamcatcher in the sixth dimension through the Late Cretaceous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Late! The Late Cretaceous!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No, I know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;An administrator comes on stage from the wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ADMINISTRATOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Uhh–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I swear, any great thinker who denies mysticism or spirituality has never dropped acid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ADMINISTRATOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Mr. Thomas–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(twirling a finger around his temple)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Like Dory from Finding Nemo? Awooooooo! Except she’s a multistellar omniscient life form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ADMINISTRATOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Could we fix Mr. Thomas’s mic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m in the bookshelf room from Interstellar shaking hands with the librarian. Spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;

For those pieces I just mean that I didn’t self-censor or revise; I had an image or an idea and ran with it. But I allowed myself to pause and think about what to say next. A real freewrite is a stream-of-consciousness piece of writing. Your only task is not to lift up the pen or stop typing – to create a continuous flow of words. Generally these are timed. The point is to get something on the page and to get into a focused state of mind to do other writing, but also to clear out all of the easy go-to phrases / images you might have in mind. Your fingers are supposed to outpace your brain, so that you discover truly novel trains of thought. You don’t correct typos or go backward. Anyway, here’s a real freewrite I found on my desktop.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I straighten myself up and look at mysel fand look into the yes and disappear into those pupils, sucked in by self interest. More like interested in self. Concerned with it. Not concerned in the sense of worry but in the sense of caught up. I get sucked into that pupil and what is inside is what is here – the inner monologue. I am already here, on a stage in a giant infinite black room. And there is a spotlight from somewhere it comes blasting in from the aether and through te dusty blackness to alight on my face. And i stand looking up into it watching the dust motes dance through the beam. I start dancing across the black infinite room. The water layer over the floor the black tile floor just splashing as i dance and land and up and go down again. The feeling of the cold water over my feet, i jump and jump and try to jump and fly out of the water so i dont land in that cold water again ;; tererribly cold ;; so cold it hurts and i can’t feel my toes; but it is okay eventually i am tired and stop with ragged breath to bend over and put my hands on my knees and sit looking at my toes and watching as they go purple with the cold and not feeling thme anymore. Sure i have frostbite but i settle into a squat ; ;; my weight on the heels lifted up from the water and resting with my elbows on my knees and my hands clasped between them just looking out at the blackness beyond the spotlight. Lokoing up at the spotlight and hpoping it dowes not get a mind of its own and continues to decide to fllow me ;; otherwise i would be beholden to it and i would chase it until my legs gave out and then i would sit in the infinite drakness watching that little beam recede until i could no longer see it and in that final moment wondering whether i still could ;; whether that was an afterimage or really the thing – like when you watch a plane until you can’t see it anymore and the precise moment when your imagination takes over and the physical reality is too far is not discernable. I wait there for the spotlight to move. Watching the outer edge of that circle. daring it to move. It does not move and so i stay there panting. Then i decide i must move again. I stand. But my legs are hurting terribly and my feet are cold. so i get on my hands and knees and crawl. And this is a poor idea because now my knees and shins and hands are cold – soo cold. but i keep crawling because to not carwl would be to die. I keep crawling forever. I crawl forever and ever. I count the paces – from one to ten. Then i begin again. Ten at a time. Ten at a time. I do not know how many times i have counted to ten. My palms are weary – my knees ache from putting them down too hard onto the black tile. I scrape my knee a bit. I scrape it again. The hands the palms are red and raw. I am tired. I count to ten again. I slow down. I need to rest, but just for a little bit. I would like to lie on my side so i do. The right side of my body is wet now. My hair dips into the water. I feel the capillary action pull the water up between the strands of hair and toward my scalp. The feeling is intoxicating. I give a little involuntary smile as the water creeps up toward my exposed scalp. My emple is bathed in water. My ear too touches the surface of the water. Resting on my shoulder. The arm laid out and extended toward the outer edge of the circle of light. It is such a dramatic gesture i can’t help but laugh a bit. Even in this situation, too dramatic. My legs too, one sprawled out straight and the other curled underneath it. I am like some fallen swan or angel in a renaissance painting. but i understand them now. I undrestand these fallen angels for why they lie like this, why the michelangelos have found them so theatrically laid out. It is comfortable. It is a comfortable position of no resistance. I am barely even living when i do this; barely even needing to exist to maintain this posture. I can simply let the water lap at my face. I can simply let the dust motes dance back and forth across the infinite beam. I can simply imagine the wolves around the edge of the circle waiting for me to expire so they can feed on my innards and spill that red blood into the pooling water and dilute the hemoglobin infinitely to one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">an example of a real stream-of-consciousness freewrite</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">fall and benny</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/09/fall-and-benny.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="fall and benny" /><published>2020-05-09T22:15:39-07:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T22:15:39-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/05/09/fall-and-benny</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/09/fall-and-benny.html">&lt;figure&gt;

    ...these friends, in fact! james read for bennie and katherine read for fall (over zoom, just for fun)
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCENE 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Bennie and Fall sit on a bench in Central Park. Or rather Fall lies along the length of the bench  with a book over her face and Bennie sits on the cement beside it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You indulge in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You indulge in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You– you– you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(he gestures grandly with his hands)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You make it this big thing. This big show of, like, how fucked up your life is and how dark it is in your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I feel like that’s a fucked up thing to say to someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;But I mean… Well, hold on – aren’t you saying that my life isn’t fucked up then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I never said that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;By implication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Well then you’re implying – err, inferring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;That’s what people do, people infer. We’re inferring machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;That’s not my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;And when you say things, you leave little spaces where the other person can infer, but not so big that they fall through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You’re doing it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You’re going abstract on me, you’re not talking to me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Now that’s abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No, you’re lecturing at the world. You’re talking to the birds or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Are you saying my life isn’t fucked up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I never said that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;So you agree that my life is fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I agree that it can be fucked up. Has been fucked up. From time to time. But is? I don’t know. That’s a big thing to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What’re you thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You’re not reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Furthermore, you’re aware that this is the kind of choice that will cast a lingering shadow. Every choice is a renunciation, or an infinity of renunciations. You will be forever after aware of the road not taken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;How are you doing that. It’s on your face. The book is on your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m just doing it. How are you doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Doing what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(nods appreciatively)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Fuckin’ A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You never say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m trying it out. I wanna be the kind of person who says, “Fuckin’ A” like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;That was cool… The– what you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Thanks… I liked the “Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah. It came out real natural. Like, “Fuckin’ A.” Just like that. Like in a movie. “Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;A woman passing with a small dog squints at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(at the dog)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(more confused than angry)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What did you say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I was talking to your dog… I said, “Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Oh. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The woman leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Fucking bitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t know. She was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Maybe you need a cigarette. To do the, “Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I think I want to fight my landlord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah, I don’t know. Like, he’s never really done anything to me. But I still feel like he’s– He’s my landlord, you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Like, he’s got something on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;And I don’t like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;So I think I wanna fight him. Or at least, like, I wanna want to fight him. Or like fantasize about it. Or like yell at him, like, “You motherfucker!” And then something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Why don’t you just do it now. Like, what would you say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Like, “You motherfucker!” Something like that. Like, “You fucking want me to pay… rent? And, like, live in this shitty apartment? And, like, every time I pass you on the stairs and you’re sweeping you give me this look that’s like, ‘Who are you?’ and it’s like, ‘I live here–’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(he groans)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Nevermind. That was stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No, it was good. I really felt something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah. I felt like, “Woah,” for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Listen, I think I’m gonna go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Bennie wanders off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Eighty-three percent of all corporate mergers fail to create any value for shareholders, and these mergers are only made after months and years of analysis…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Lights down on him talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCENE 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;A party in Fall’s apartment. Music is blaring and people are packed in. Bennie and Fall gyrate awkwardly but confidently. A WOMAN comes up to Fall and shouts in his ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;There’s someone at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay, let them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t think it’s that kind of person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Whaddaya mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I think they’re angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(she makes a “not my problem” face and walks away)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(to Bennie)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I wanna kick her out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You can’t kick people out just because they say something you don’t like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;It’s my place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah, but this is a party, not, like, an inquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Come back me up at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;They go to the door and open it. Their landlord, Job Renkins, stands there furious. He does a lot of strong pointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What the fuck is going on in here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Hi, Job Renkins. We’re having a party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You can’t have a party! There are no parties here! You can’t do this– I mean, I’m blown away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;It’s just a small one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Just a small one? I mean – I’m blown away. Can you imagine the inconsideration!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Inconsiderate to who?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;To your neighbors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I think it’s “whom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Whom?” We invited all the neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;It’s the object of the sentence, not the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Oh, that’s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t care. Are you listening to me? I don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Job Renkins, come on. It’s 11PM on a Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t care what time it is! And you don’t have to call me “Job Renkins,” you can just say “Job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Mr. Job Renkins, it’s just a little one. It’s a very little one – you can come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t want to come in! I want everybody out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(to Bennie)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Landlords are like vampires. You have to invite them in… Fuck, that didn’t land, did it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Is that true? Oh, it’s a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I want everybody out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Look, Mr. Job Renkins, if you’re not coming in, I’m going to have to close the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No– no!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m sorry, but you’re letting all the sound into the hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;He closes the door. Job Renkins pounds on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t know if you should have done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Well I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;That’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;They stand there a moment listening to Job Renkins screaming at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCENE 2.5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;A pretty woman stands around talking to Fall and Bennie. She’s trying to talk to Fall mostly, because he’s pretty as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Do? Most days I guess I just sit around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;She means for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Oh, for work–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;We’re both retired tech trash. Err, well, not really retired. More just like we quit. Yeah, we quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;We quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You quit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;How old are you? Oh, sorry – I guess that’s rude–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No, no. I’m 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;And you quit. For good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I mean, that would be retired. We’re not retired. Can’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Sort of just waiting around for the money to run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah, I mean, it sounds kind of funny, but we both just decided we didn’t want to work anymore and so we stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Worked for a few years in “the valley” as they say…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(no one laughs and he groans)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;So then hit a wall and just quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah, like sort of a soul wall. Like a wall in our souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Like, “beneath all of the performed happiness and scripted fullness of Silicon Valley life lies a deep-seated discontent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What was that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I was quoting something. Or, like, that could be a quote. I just said it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m going to get another drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;All right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(to Bennie)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I wanna kick her out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">a couple of nonsensical play scenes i wrote for some friends</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">good life</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/20/good-life.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="good life" /><published>2020-03-20T22:15:39-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-20T22:15:39-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/03/20/good-life</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/20/good-life.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-do-you-believe-makes-for-a-life-well-lived-and-what-are-the-ways-in-which-your-actions-do-or-dont-align-with-that-overarching-purpose&quot;&gt;What do you believe makes for a life well lived, and what are the ways in which your actions do (or don’t) align with that overarching purpose?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to come up with an exhaustive definition of the good life. It’s all approximate. There is always something lost by putting intangibles into words, and it’s pointless to go about fiddling with semantics and qualifying statements in pursuit of exactitude because that could go on indefinitely. All of this is to say that everything that follows is reductionist to some degree. But here goes. If I had to identify what I think makes for a life well lived I would say there are two components: fulfilling relationships and fulfilling work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oxford Dictionary defines fulfilling as “making someone satisfied or happy because of fully developing their character or abilities.” I define fulfilling as “making someone satisfied or happy by fostering progress in developing their character or abilities.” No one is ever fully developed, but that which is fulfilling to me encourages (or even guarantees) a sense of continual development. The things in my life that are fulfilling force me to move forward. They deny me the chance to stagnate.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By fulfilling work, I mean work that engages me, that challenges me and gives me a sense that there are mountains left to climb and that these mountains are worth climbing. I think challenge is important to me because it makes me unhappy to ever feel that I’ve plateaued or that I’ve used my time poorly. I take a lot of pleasure from learning every day, and from looking back on each year in wonder at how much I have grown. This pleasure is what I demand from fulfilling work in return for my time. Maybe this definition comes close to that of a passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that I find multiple sources of fulfilling work in my life. Hobbies, sports, and careers are all types of work, and they are fulfilling so long as they make me feel that I’m becoming a better or more whole person through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, my sense of individuality or identity feeds into my work and vice versa. Not in that I define myself by my work, but in that I see my work as an expression of self. In &lt;em&gt;The Communist Manifesto&lt;/em&gt; Marx talks about how the problem with work under industrial capitalism is that it is soulless. In contrast, the independent craftsperson (say, a shoemaker) puts some sense of their identity into their products. Their shoes are a form of self-expression. Only they can produce their particular shoes. I’m no goddamned Commie. But fulfilling work should have this sense of entanglement with my individuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By fulfilling relationships, I mean relationships that make me feel happy and whole and comfortable, sure, but I also mean relationships that foster that sense of progress by which I defined fulfillment. A fulfilling relationship is one that challenges me to be better, to step outside of my comfort zone, and to understand different ways of viewing the world or interacting with people. This implies that fulfilling relationships should often be with people who are very different from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;my friends!&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/couch.jpeg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;my friends!&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/fancy_party.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    some fulfilling relationships :)
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could further divide relationships into the romantic, the core friendships, and the peripheral friendships – all of which I think are important. The romantic, or love, gives life some of its spark. It makes it exciting. A fulfilling love is one that isn’t just exciting for its novelty or for the potential energy it represents before it is realized (because these things fade after a while). It is exciting because the other person is a constant source of novelty. They see the world in a way that is refreshing or surprising to me again and again, and because of this I learn to see the world newly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core friendships in my life grant me a sense of being truly known and of having unconditional support. Just like good romantic partners, they are a constant source of novelty, and hopefully I am a source of novelty to them. This implies that we are often introducing each other to new ways of viewing things, and as such, a certain level of open discussion and disagreement is a good sign of a healthy close friendship. These people are the family I choose and I’m lucky to have them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peripheral friends are the people I see once in a while or maybe only in certain settings, and while they contribute less to my happiness than my core friends, they still add to my life. They give me a sense of being socially engaged, of being open to new social opportunities, and of always having a rich social frontier that changes and adapts. Core friends often start as peripheral friends, which is what makes this frontier exciting. Having these people around encourages me to develop socially rather than stagnating. It also gives me a sense that I am a member of a bigger community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding how these components contribute to an “overarching purpose,” I would say that both fulfilling relationships and fulfilling work are sources of both purpose and meaning. But I want to draw a distinction between purpose and meaning. Purpose, to me, is an animating force. It’s a reason to get up in the morning. Fulfilling work is primarily a source of purpose, because it is a source of everyday action in pursuit of a long-term goal. Meaning is a found thing. It’s interpreted. Fulfilling relationships are primarily sources of meaning, because the people we surround ourselves with lend us their worldviews, philosophies, and methods of reconciling the irreconcilable in life. Of course, these two forces are entangled. Meaning arises from purpose: there is no intrinsic meaning to life for me, only the meaning we make. And purpose facilitates that making of our own meaning because it propels us down some path and determines which world we see. To use a tired analogy, if life is a series of crossroads, purpose determines the turns we make, and meaning is what we make of those turns. It informs what we make of the sights we see as we travel. A rich sense of meaning is a good indicator that one has purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I see myself as enacting this vision of the good life? I’m working on it. I’m learning how to find fulfilling work and fulfilling relationships both. I’m not sure how I’m doing and I’m definitely not sure where I’m going. But I’m making progress, slowly, and given that this is a sign of fulfillment, I’d say that I’m on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The terms “guarantee,” “force me,” and “deny me” may be too strong. Under these definitions, fulfillment is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for goodness, because overwork, for example, forces you to make progress but I wouldn’t consider it good. Fulfillment in this case is a sort of lower bound and requires a matching upper bound – though maybe overwork undoes progress in the realm of character development and is therefore by definition not fulfilling. I’m not sure. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

The sky was pregnant and orange. She stepped through the leaves and onto the lawn of the old house. The patchy lawn with its hateful bald spots. The wilted grass and the overgrown weeds at the edges of the house. The house-shaped house with its peeling siding and hopeful white paint job. As if anything could have grown there. The dead windows staring out at her. The door, solid as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She turned to look. There was no one in the street behind her. No one as far as she could see. She bent and picked up a stone from the lawn. She hurled it at the door. She grunted as she did so. The stone made a little sound as it impacted and then skittered away. The sound was too little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She found another stone and threw it at one of the eyes. It shattered just as she’d dreamed it would. The shattering had the weight of everything. She tossed back her head and laughed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She found another rock and hurled it at the other eye. It too shattered, and she treasured the tinkling of the shards. But when it was done, she found the dead eyes still watched her, maybe even more deeply without the glasses. They made her uneasy. And still there was the door. Solid as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She came up the walk, watching the door. It didn’t flinch. She came up the stairs. It dwarfed her. Hateful thing. She stepped back and clenched her hands. They were sweaty. It really was a big door. She took a deep breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I hate you,” she said, and with a running step forward she kicked the door. It didn’t give. Her toes hurt, but it was a good hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fuck!” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She kicked it again. She struck it with the flat of her hand, then punched it, and punched it again, and again, bringing her raw knuckles down on the wood like a gavel. It shuddered in its frame but gave nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She stepped back when the skin on her knuckles was scraped red. She stepped away and the door stood. But she smiled at it. She backed down the steps and turned and went back down the overcast road. She went to her car and took the necessities from her trunk.
On the walk back there was no one out, but she didn’t care anymore. Her steps were strong and fluid. She allowed herself to bounce as she walked. The trees nodded at her and she smiled back at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She came to the lawn and crossed it and went to the dead window on the left. She peered in and saw the old and dusty clutter. Still a couch in there, bursting and dried up like a prune. She aimed for the couch, but it was hard to aim and she settled for splashing it over the walls and on the floorboards. When the canister was nearly empty she went up to the door and poured the rest through the gap underneath. Then she stepped away and backed off to the street. From there it didn’t look any different. It looked just as capable as ever. She laughed and went to the window and flicked a lit match at the couch. The smell was gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thoughts&quot;&gt;thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a freewrite, this is a cool piece. (I guess I use the term ‘freewrite’ more liberally than I should – generally a freewrite is a fully unedited, stream-of-consciousness piece. You don’t let your fingers stop typing, you don’t correct typos, etc. I posted an &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/11/28/black-room.html&quot;&gt;actual freewrite here&lt;/a&gt; if you’re curious what that looks like. This was a freewrite only in the sense that I had no plan, I just started writing, but I allowed myself to pause and think briefly – which, granted, defeats the whole purpose of a freewrite.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think while I was writing this I wanted to try to give this inanimate object of the house a character. But I ended up reflecting most of that character onto the protagonist – the weird descriptions become her descriptions, which reveal her disturbed mental state. “House-shaped house” is funny to me; I know what I was trying to do there but I don’t know if it worked. I think “as if anything could have grown there” is a pretty dark and intriguing note. Once I wrote that, I figured this could be a piece about someone who’s been driven to extremes by past trauma, and I played into it. That’s where “the trees nodded at her” came from, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like “bringing her raw knuckles down on the wood like a gavel.” Ocean Vuong has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_abelisaurus_/status/1330057648801198081?lang=en&quot;&gt;brilliant series of Instagram stories on metaphor&lt;/a&gt; in which he argues that metaphor has to work on a sensory level and a logical level. A metaphor that exists just because the writer connected two unlike images and went, “That’s pretty cool, I should toss that in,” is a poor metaphor. Even if the images are connected and interesting. The movement from the first image to the second image has to also reveal something about the first image and imbue it with new meaning / logic. In communicating that the protagonist has suffered some injustice and is now righting it, the gavel image does this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">a freewrite</summary></entry></feed>
