I guess in some ill-lit cave at the base of my brain stem, I do, but the human in me is tired and just wants to sleep. But I give a little smile and say Yes, because she is fragile in her offering, because she is timid and the forthrightness is difficult for her. If I told her No it would devastate her. She says Okay. She starts to fumble with the top button of her shirt – she is stiff with nerves, performing this part of a girl who knows what to do here. I laugh and put a hand on her hip and pull her toward where I am seated on the edge of the bed. I say Let me. She looks down at me and her hair falls into my eyes. She laughs now and arranges her hair over her shoulder. I reach for her top button and ask Can I? And she nods. I unbutton her shirt and she shrugs it off and looks at me as if for approval. I slide my hands over her thin shoulders and down to her waist and pretend to be more overcome with desire than I am. Normally I would not have to pretend, but at the moment I want to sleep. I put my head against her stomach and close my eyes. She runs her fingers through my hair and this does give me a rush of pleasure – I have always liked the feeling of someone’s nails tracing over my scalp. It gives me chills. I hook my fingers on the inside of her waistband and make my way around to the front and ask Can I, and she says Yes, and I unbutton her jeans and take them down without opening my eyes. I really am tired. I pull her down and onto my lap and hold onto her, and she holds my head but there is the lingering question of What now? I don’t know how to tell her I just want to sleep. After a minute she says We can just sleep, and I feel myself flush with gratitude. I laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read me, huh, I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can read you, she says softly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fall back into bed and pull her alongside me. She throws a leg over my legs and puts her head on my chest, a hand on the side of my neck. I close my eyes. She looks up at me every once in a while, maybe to check if I am still awake. I drift a bit into the semi-consciousness which is often the closest I can get to sleep with someone else in my bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you still think about her? she asks, so quietly that at first I think I am dreaming. I don’t open my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I say. Yeah. Is that okay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you thinking about her now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to say, I say. I feel her head move against my chest as she nods. She is quiet. I drift again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you wish she was here instead of me? she whispers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city quiets, pressed up in its dim blue light against the blinds. As if to listen in. A train passing under the distant highway overpass groans, and the cars race down Telegraph, their tires hissing on the pavement. Somewhere, an ambulance or fire truck wails and I think it is odd that I enjoy that sound, though it announces emergency, because from far off it reminds me of the city, becomes ambient, loses urgency. I am weightless in the event horizon of sleep. I hear that whisper over and over. It takes my breath away. By the time I realize I have not answered, her breathing is slow and deep and she twitches in the involuntary way of someone dreaming. I approach the asymptote of sleep, thinking of how fucked up I am over her, the other her, hearing that whisper over and over again: Do you wish she was here instead of me?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">something from a freewrite</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">fall and benny</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/09/fall-and-benny.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="fall and benny" /><published>2020-05-09T22:15:39-07:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T22:15:39-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/05/09/fall-and-benny</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/09/fall-and-benny.html">&lt;p&gt;SCENE 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Bennie and Fall sit on a bench in Central Park. Or rather Fall lies along the length of the bench  with a book over her face and Bennie sits on the cement beside it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You indulge in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You indulge in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You– you– you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(he gestures grandly with his hands)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You make it this big thing. This big show of, like, how fucked up your life is and how dark it is in your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I feel like that’s a fucked up thing to say to someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;But I mean… Well, hold on – aren’t you saying that my life isn’t fucked up then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I never said that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;By implication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Well then you’re implying – err, inferring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;That’s what people do, people infer. We’re inferring machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;That’s not my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;And when you say things, you leave little spaces where the other person can infer, but not so big that they fall through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You’re doing it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You’re going abstract on me, you’re not talking to me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Now that’s abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No, you’re lecturing at the world. You’re talking to the birds or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Are you saying my life isn’t fucked up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I never said that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;So you agree that my life is fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I agree that it can be fucked up. Has been fucked up. From time to time. But is? I don’t know. That’s a big thing to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What’re you thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You’re not reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Furthermore, you’re aware that this is the kind of choice that will cast a lingering shadow. Every choice is a renunciation, or an infinity of renunciations. You will be forever after aware of the road not taken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;How are you doing that. It’s on your face. The book is on your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m just doing it. How are you doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Doing what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(nods appreciatively)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Fuckin’ A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You never say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m trying it out. I wanna be the kind of person who says, “Fuckin’ A” like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;That was cool… The– what you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Thanks… I liked the “Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah. It came out real natural. Like, “Fuckin’ A.” Just like that. Like in a movie. “Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;A woman passing with a small dog squints at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(at the dog)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(more confused than angry)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What did you say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I was talking to your dog… I said, “Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Oh. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The woman leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Fucking bitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t know. She was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Maybe you need a cigarette. To do the, “Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I think I want to fight my landlord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah, I don’t know. Like, he’s never really done anything to me. But I still feel like he’s– He’s my landlord, you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Like, he’s got something on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;And I don’t like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;So I think I wanna fight him. Or at least, like, I wanna want to fight him. Or like fantasize about it. Or like yell at him, like, “You motherfucker!” And then something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Why don’t you just do it now. Like, what would you say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Like, “You motherfucker!” Something like that. Like, “You fucking want me to pay… rent? And, like, live in this shitty apartment? And, like, every time I pass you on the stairs and you’re sweeping you give me this look that’s like, ‘Who are you?’ and it’s like, ‘I live here–’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(he groans)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Nevermind. That was stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No, it was good. I really felt something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah. I felt like, “Woah,” for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Listen, I think I’m gonna go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Bennie wanders off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Eighty-three percent of all corporate mergers fail to create any value for shareholders, and these mergers are only made after months and years of analysis…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Lights down on him talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCENE 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;A party in Fall’s apartment. Music is blaring and people are packed in. Bennie and Fall gyrate awkwardly but confidently. A WOMAN comes up to Fall and shouts in his ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;There’s someone at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay, let them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t think it’s that kind of person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Whaddaya mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I think they’re angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(she makes a “not my problem” face and walks away)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(to Bennie)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I wanna kick her out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You can’t kick people out just because they say something you don’t like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;It’s my place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah, but this is a party, not, like, an inquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Come back me up at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;They go to the door and open it. Their landlord, Job Renkins, stands there furious. He does a lot of strong pointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What the fuck is going on in here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Hi, Job Renkins. We’re having a party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You can’t have a party! There are no parties here! You can’t do this– I mean, I’m blown away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;It’s just a small one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Just a small one? I mean – I’m blown away. Can you imagine the inconsideration!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Inconsiderate to who?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;To your neighbors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I think it’s “whom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Whom?” We invited all the neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;It’s the object of the sentence, not the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Oh, that’s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t care. Are you listening to me? I don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Job Renkins, come on. It’s 11PM on a Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t care what time it is! And you don’t have to call me “Job Renkins,” you can just say “Job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Mr. Job Renkins, it’s just a little one. It’s a very little one – you can come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t want to come in! I want everybody out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(to Bennie)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Landlords are like vampires. You have to invite them in… Fuck, that didn’t land, did it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Is that true? Oh, it’s a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I want everybody out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Look, Mr. Job Renkins, if you’re not coming in, I’m going to have to close the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No– no!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m sorry, but you’re letting all the sound into the hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;He closes the door. Job Renkins pounds on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t know if you should have done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Well I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;That’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;They stand there a moment listening to Job Renkins screaming at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;SCENE 2.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;A pretty woman stands around talking to Fall and Bennie. She’s trying to talk to Fall mostly, because he’s pretty as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Do? Most days I guess I just sit around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;She means for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Oh, for work–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;We’re both retired tech trash. Err, well, not really retired. More just like we quit. Yeah, we quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;We quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You quit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;How old are you? Oh, sorry – I guess that’s rude–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No, no. I’m 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;And you quit. For good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I mean, that would be retired. We’re not retired. Can’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Sort of just waiting around for the money to run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah, I mean, it sounds kind of funny, but we both just decided we didn’t want to work anymore and so we stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Worked for a few years in “the valley” as they say…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(no one laughs and he groans)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;So then hit a wall and just quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah, like sort of a soul wall. Like a wall in our souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Like, “beneath all of the performed happiness and scripted fullness of Silicon Valley life lies a deep-seated discontent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What was that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I was quoting something. Or, like, that could be a quote. I just said it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m going to get another drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;All right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(to Bennie)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I wanna kick her out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">a couple of nonsensical play scenes i wrote for some friends</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">good life</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/20/good-life.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="good life" /><published>2020-03-20T22:15:39-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-20T22:15:39-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/03/20/good-life</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/20/good-life.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-do-you-believe-makes-for-a-life-well-lived-and-what-are-the-ways-in-which-your-actions-do-or-dont-align-with-that-overarching-purpose&quot;&gt;What do you believe makes for a life well lived, and what are the ways in which your actions do (or don’t) align with that overarching purpose?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to come up with an exhaustive definition of the good life. It’s all approximate. There is always something lost by putting intangibles into words, and it’s pointless to go about fiddling with semantics and qualifying statements in pursuit of exactitude because that could go on indefinitely. All of this is to say that everything that follows is reductionist to some degree. But here goes. If I had to identify what I think makes for a life well lived I would say there are two components: fulfilling relationships and fulfilling work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oxford Dictionary defines fulfilling as “making someone satisfied or happy because of fully developing their character or abilities.” I define fulfilling as “making someone satisfied or happy by fostering progress in developing their character or abilities.” No one is ever fully developed, but that which is fulfilling to me encourages (or even guarantees) a sense of continual development. The things in my life that are fulfilling force me to move forward. They deny me the chance to stagnate.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By fulfilling work, I mean work that engages me, that challenges me and gives me a sense that there are mountains left to climb and that these mountains are worth climbing. I think challenge is important to me because it makes me unhappy to ever feel that I’ve plateaued or that I’ve used my time poorly. I take a lot of pleasure from learning every day, and from looking back on each year in wonder at how much I have grown. This pleasure is what I demand from fulfilling work in return for my time. Maybe this definition comes close to that of a passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that I find multiple sources of fulfilling work in my life. Hobbies, sports, and careers are all types of work, and they are fulfilling so long as they make me feel that I’m becoming a better or more whole person through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, my sense of individuality or identity feeds into my work and vice versa. Not in that I define myself by my work, but in that I see my work as an expression of self. In &lt;em&gt;The Communist Manifesto&lt;/em&gt; Marx talks about how the problem with work under industrial capitalism is that it is soulless. In contrast, the independent craftsperson (say, a shoemaker) puts some sense of their identity into their products. Their shoes are a form of self-expression. Only they can produce their particular shoes. I’m no goddamned Commie. But fulfilling work should have this sense of entanglement with my individuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By fulfilling relationships, I mean relationships that make me feel happy and whole and comfortable, sure, but I also mean relationships that foster that sense of progress by which I defined fulfillment. A fulfilling relationship is one that challenges me to be better, to step outside of my comfort zone, and to understand different ways of viewing the world or interacting with people. This implies that fulfilling relationships should often be with people who are very different from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could further divide relationships into the romantic, the core friendships, and the peripheral friendships – all of which I think are important. The romantic, or love, gives life some of its spark. It makes it exciting. A fulfilling love is one that isn’t just exciting for its novelty or for the potential energy it represents before it is realized (because these things fade after a while). It is exciting because the other person is a constant source of novelty. They see the world in a way that is refreshing or surprising to me again and again, and because of this I learn to see the world newly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core friendships in my life grant me a sense of being truly known and of having unconditional support. Just like good romantic partners, they are a constant source of novelty, and hopefully I am a source of novelty to them. This implies that we are often introducing each other to new ways of viewing things, and as such, a certain level of open discussion and disagreement is a good sign of a healthy close friendship. These people are the family I choose and I’m lucky to have them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peripheral friends are the people I see once in a while or maybe only in certain settings, and while they contribute less to my happiness than my core friends, they still add to my life. They give me a sense of being socially engaged, of being open to new social opportunities, and of always having a rich social frontier that changes and adapts. Core friends often start as peripheral friends, which is what makes this frontier exciting. Having these people around encourages me to develop socially rather than stagnating. It also gives me a sense that I am a member of a bigger community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding how these components contribute to an “overarching purpose,” I would say that both fulfilling relationships and fulfilling work are sources of both purpose and meaning. But I want to draw a distinction between purpose and meaning. Purpose, to me, is an animating force. It’s a reason to get up in the morning. Fulfilling work is primarily a source of purpose, because it is a source of everyday action in pursuit of a long-term goal. Meaning is a found thing. It’s interpreted. Fulfilling relationships are primarily sources of meaning, because the people we surround ourselves with lend us their worldviews, philosophies, and methods of reconciling the irreconcilable in life. Of course, these two forces are entangled. Meaning arises from purpose: there is no intrinsic meaning to life for me, only the meaning we make. And purpose facilitates that making of our own meaning because it propels us down some path and determines which world we see. To use a tired analogy, if life is a series of crossroads, purpose determines the turns we make, and meaning is what we make of those turns. It informs what we make of the sights we see as we travel. A rich sense of meaning is a good indicator that one has purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I see myself as enacting this vision of the good life? I’m working on it. I’m learning how to find fulfilling work and fulfilling relationships both. I’m not sure how I’m doing and I’m definitely not sure where I’m going. But I’m making progress, slowly, and given that this is a sign of fulfillment, I’d say that I’m on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The terms “guarantee,” “force me,” and “deny me” may be too strong. Under these definitions, fulfillment is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for goodness, because overwork, for example, forces you to make progress but I wouldn’t consider it good. Fulfillment in this case is a sort of lower bound and requires a matching upper bound – though maybe overwork undoes progress in the realm of character development and is therefore by definition not fulfilling. I’m not sure. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

My parents always used to say that after a certain point the milestones grow few and far between and thirty, then forty, comes before you know it. I treated this with the usual youthful skepticism. But recently, in wrestling with the torturous question of my career (“What do you want to do after graduating?”) I see how this might be true. How one temporary ambition may lead to another. How so many holdovers put in place to make room to breathe and think and plan might string together into ten years or twenty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear the same sort of indecision in my friends’ voices when we talk. “If only we could slow the pace,” we all seem to be saying. But I know that I could sit here forever drafting up possible futures and never picking one. That the only way to decide is to try and err and try again and find contentment eventually in some local optimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, my friends and I talk and make crackpot schemes as thin as tissue paper based on criteria we don’t quite feel as real yet like “profitability” or “stability.” But I can see how these schemes could harden into plans into schedules into routines. I can see how easy it would be to forget that they were arbitrary, that they were gossamer strands met by desperate hands relieved to grasp at anything solid. That they were adopted merely as a thing to say. As a ready answer to the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s all right. Because life is non-convex. There is no closed form solution, the error surface is riddled with local minima, and only stochastic iterative methods exist to optimize it. Stochastic because we are bad at optimizing in multiple dimensions at once. This is all part of the process. I’m not afraid of the local minimum. I’m just afraid that I will mistake happenstance for destiny, because then I will be stuck, too afraid to reinitialize with a random starting vector. I’m not afraid of the descent. I’m just afraid it will feel like falling.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">some thoughts i wrote down on the arbitrariness of making big decisions</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">blinds</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/03/27/blinds.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="blinds" /><published>2019-03-27T22:15:39-07:00</published><updated>2019-03-27T22:15:39-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/03/27/blinds</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/03/27/blinds.html">&lt;p&gt;The light was gray and weak coming through the vertical blinds, and when I turned my head to match the angle of the slats I could see the sky beyond, as low and gray as an augury. Dust blackened the edges of the slats and piled on the blades of the broken ceiling fan. Maybe it wasn’t dust but ash from the cigarettes Will and I smoked indoors too frequently. Will slept on the other side of the bedroom, in his bed which was no more than six feet from mine and striped with the light coming through the window. One bar of light fell over his face and I wondered how he didn’t stir. I woke with the slightest hint of day; some days I woke just with the brightening of the eastern rim of the world, not even the rising of the sun. I wondered if Will knew how long the morning could be in coming. How it could stretch out for hours from that first lifting of the darkness to the stirrings of the streets outside, with me all the while blinking in the dimness and lying still so as not to be awake just yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">another little freewrite!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">driveway</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/02/14/driveway.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="driveway" /><published>2018-02-14T21:15:39-08:00</published><updated>2018-02-14T21:15:39-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/02/14/driveway</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/02/14/driveway.html">&lt;p&gt;In the falling night I sat in the driveway by my cousins, Kim and Allison. The two of them sat on the stoop and rolled their cigarettes. They bent their rolling papers and lay down the centers two lines of tobacco taken from plastic pouches. They rolled the cigarettes with filters at one end and twisted the other ends. When they were finished Kim fished a lighter from her hoodie pocket and lit her cigarette, then Allison’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said to Allison, “I remember you used to do this behind the house in Biot. We went on a walk, you and I and maybe Camille, and it was late in the night. You showed us how you rolled a cigarette, and then when we got home we sat on your bed and you were on Microsoft Live.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corners of Allison’s mouth lifted. She tilted her head. “Maybe. I think that was before anyone knew that I smoked.”
Kim laughed. The two sisters sat identically, with one knee drawn up to their chest and one leg outstretched, an elbow resting on the drawn-up knee, cigarette dangling from between two fingers. They sat and smoked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allison was twenty-eight and pale-skinned and fair-haired and thin. Her hair nearly glowed, even with the light so low and the sky dark and indigo. My older cousin had told me once in a hushed tone, “I always got the impression that she was fragile. Not sick, but fragile.” Kim was, if not the opposite, close. Energetic and always grinning and making jokes. She had big brown curls and wore sweatpants most days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t seen them in ten years. They hadn’t seen each other in three. They leaned against each other and Kim smiled at me. “You’ll have to come see me in Australia,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Me too,” Allison said. She was leaving Paris at the end of the month to join Kim and her girlfriend in Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She planned to open a business breeding dogs, or maybe training them – I wasn’t sure. Allison leaned her head against Kim’s shoulder and looked up. “The stars are amazing here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just wait until you get to Sydney,” Kim said. She tapped her cigarette on her sandal and the ash fell away. “We can go on a road trip. You’ve never seen anything like it, I promise. There’s no one out there in the middle. You can drive for fifteen hours and not see a person, and the land is flat in places. Sometimes you can’t even look up for more than a few minutes, because there are too many stars. It makes you scared. You head starts to swirl.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sounds like a fun place to be high,” Allison said. I laughed with her, but Kim just took a drag from her cigarette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not really. It’s pretty at first, but it makes you panic. Really, I’m not joking. At least for me, you look up for that long, it’s like you’re losing your mind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked up. The stars were better than in San Francisco, but with the trees behind the house the field of view was limited. Still, I knew what she meant. On a backpacking trip to Point Reyes my high school friends and I had pitched our tents and smoked a few bowls of weed, and we stumbled through that night losing and finding one another, falling back and lying spread-eagle and frozen with the terror and beauty that we would die one day and stay dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim and Allison finished their cigarettes. They went inside, where my siblings, Aya, Camille, and Julien, were waiting to play a game of cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stayed out and thought about Biot. It was a small town near Nice. Until I was ten, my parents rented a house there each summer. They sent an open invitation to the extended family, and often we had twenty or twenty-five people staying with us, each for a week or so. It was how Camille, Julien, Aya, and I met our grandparents, our uncles and aunts, and most of our cousins. It was a way of bridging the Atlantic Ocean that lay between us and the rest of our family, so that to the younger cousins, even if we were &lt;em&gt;les Américains&lt;/em&gt;, at least we were not strangers. It was during the first of those summers that we met Kim and Allison, who must have been twelve and ten at the time, and played with them in the pool and lay like fish on the deck and chased each other on tricycles and ate lunch still in our swimsuits and read &lt;em&gt;Asterix&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tintin&lt;/em&gt; until we were told to go outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes I grew cold and went inside to play cards. We played until midnight. Then Kim yawned and Aya said, “We should let you sleep so you don’t keel over in the airport tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think so,” Kim said. Kim and Allison stood up. Kim looked at us from across the table and the empty bottles of rum. She said, “Maybe it’ll be another ten years until we see each other. I’ll be nearly forty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ll see each other before then,” Julien said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe.” Kim stretched and yawned and headed for the door. At the door she stopped and looked back and thought for a second, as if she was sure this was the last time she would see us in a very long time. She said finally, “We’ll see each other for all of our lives.” She slipped out and went to her room, and we said nothing about it and went to sleep ourselves. In the morning I woke and they were already gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were nights that summer that I stayed up in the darkened bedroom just listening to my brother snore. It was the first summer we spent back together after we had all left the house for college and work, and I was struck by the thought that this is what it meant to be a family of adults. We would see each other only when we could; when paid time off and hectic schedules aligned. It didn’t feel any different than it had all those nights I’d stayed up listening to my brother snore when he was ten and we shared a bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes I thought about the four of us growing old and distant, separated by many miles. I thought that not everyone grows old and that there were four of us, and that one day three of us would bury the fourth. Thinking this, my throat grew tight and I felt as if a great weight was pressing down on me. I listened to my brother’s breathing. Every so often there came the grating noise of his teeth grinding in his sleep. And I would think, “It will be a long time before that happens. Don’t worry, you have a long time.” And I would sleep. And it would be all right just for the night. But still I knew that we wouldn’t have each other forever…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">an excerpt from a reflection i wrote on family</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">graduation</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/07/10/graduation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="graduation" /><published>2017-07-10T22:15:39-07:00</published><updated>2017-07-10T22:15:39-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2017/07/10/graduation</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/07/10/graduation.html">&lt;p&gt;I went to three high school graduations before my own. I went to my brother Julien’s. I went to my sister Aya’s. I went to my sister Camille’s. Each time, it felt like the world had opened up in front of them. They wore red robes and sat in the amphitheater in front of the elm trees and the flag poles that held up the class flags from years past. They sat and the sky was blue and the principal said many pretty things that were the same each year and my dad ran up the aisle to kneel at the front and take a photo when my sibling took their diploma. I thought, “That’ll be me one day.” And then it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Maxime&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/graduation.jpeg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    My mom, me, my godmother, and my sister. Despite the tone of this piece, I look pretty happy here :)
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rehearsed graduation twice that day, and stood in line in the school gymnasium, and was sweaty and hot in the morning and cold in the afternoon when the rain came in. It didn’t rain at graduation. The rain stopped an hour before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When graduation started I stood in the grass field behind the amphitheater with the rest of my class. The end of the field was a hill that rose up to meet the top of the amphitheater where the elms grew. There was a crowd behind the hill: I could hear them though I couldn’t see them. I knew my parents were in the crowd. I knew where they would be sitting, dead center on the left side of the aisle. I turned to my friend Dylan, who was beside me. I said, “Is this really happening?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He blinked at me. He said, “Yeah, I guess so.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said, “This is really happening. This is the day we graduate high school.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wind swept through the ranks of my classmates. I shivered and adjusted my mortarboard. Down the row and along the rows in front of me I could see people fussing with their tassels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dylan grinned. “This is the day we’ll remember for the rest of our lives. Soak it up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s glorious,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We waited for five more minutes until the principal concluded his opening remarks. We heard them faintly from over the hill. Then, without warning, the vice-principal on the right side of the front row raised her hands in the air. We all perked up. She gave the signal. The first row ran up the hill and stood at the top. The crowd beyond cheered, and we did as well, and the row split into halves and the halves turned to face each other and each pair of students shook hands and walked down into the amphitheater. We advanced a row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One by one, five rows stood at the top of the amphitheater and split and shook hands and walked down. Then I stood at the front and the vice-principal raised her hands and we ran, Dylan and I, and stood at the top of the amphitheater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crowd looked close and small. It had felt enormous and claustrophobic when I had sat in it, and my siblings had seemed to be miles away, just red dots. The sky was gray and the concrete under my shoe soles was wet. I stood for a second and turned, and shook a hand, and walked down and took my seat behind a potted fern. I sat in stunned silence as the principal said the same things as he had the years before. He called out names and students rose one by one and walked down the aisle and took their diplomas. Friends of each graduate hooted and clapped as the names were called, and sometimes people in the crowd cheered as well. You could tell who was well-liked and who was not by the applause at their name, and I was grateful when I was called and my friends clapped and they were loud. I didn’t want my parents to hear dead silence at my name. There were always students whose names were met with dead silence. In our class it was [redacted]&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I remember thinking, “At least it wasn’t me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was over. I took photos with my friends: photos from the day I graduated high school. I took photos with my parents. I received my real diploma from the school cafeteria, since the diplomas they handed out on stage were fakes – or rather they were just the empty leather folders for the diplomas. I congratulated my friends, one by one. My mom found me by the cafeteria and said, “We should go before the traffic gets too bad.” We walked across the parking lot and I took off my robes and my mortarboard and put them in the trunk of the car, and we left just as the crowd began to head our way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents took me out for dinner, and after dinner I said goodbye to them and walked back to the high school, where my friend Daniel was to pick me up. All of my friends and I were going somewhere, maybe to the beach, to spend the night together.
When I reached the high school, the sun dipped behind Mount Tam. The sky went purple to the east. I stuck my hands in my pockets and walked very slowly toward the field, where my parents had sat, where I had sat three times to watch my siblings walk. The chairs had been folded by the custodial staff and left in stacks here and there around the field like hay bales. The class flags had been left up, and I watched them. I saw the flag from my brother’s graduating year, five years before my own. I saw the flag from my sister’s year, and my other sister’s year. I saw my own flag in the middle, flapping in the wind, and thought of all the flags that would come after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was grateful for the silence. It was so quiet I could hear the cars on the highway in the distance and the passenger jet somewhere above the low clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked across the field and up the amphitheater steps. I stopped behind the fern, where I had been sitting. I stood there and looked out at the field and said quietly, “I graduated high school today. Here. I graduated high school.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted the words to ripple out from my mouth and make something happen, whatever was supposed to. But everything stayed as it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in the ensuing silence that I saw the front door to the far-off school building open. A man with a long beard, wearing a flannel shirt and jeans, stepped out. He put his tote bag down and turned and locked the door behind him and began to walk toward the parking lot. I watched and didn’t say anything. As he turned right on the path to the parking lot, he saw me. He stopped and raised a hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Mr. [Fakename]&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, who had taught me English in my freshman and junior years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waved back. He raised a finger – one second – and walked toward me across the field. When he reached the amphitheater, he scraped his boots on the concrete to remove the mud. He looked up at me and said, “Mind if I join?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He climbed the steps and sat beside me, and was silent for a moment, looking out across the field toward the school. He said, “What are you doing?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m waiting for Daniel,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are you going somewhere?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to the beach, I think.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The beach? At this hour?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re not going to swim,” I said. “I don’t think we’re going to swim.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay.” He looked at me for a long moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He knew me well enough. He was one of the good ones, one of the teachers I’d miss, though his classes hadn’t been particularly hard or useful. Most days he sat at the front of the room at his desk. He always began his classes with the words, “Students, take out your notebooks.” But he never taught us anything we could write in a notebook. He disregarded the texts he assigned us to read for most of class, and instead told us stories about his youth. About the time he’d dropped acid with his friends and climbed the fence to his high school swimming pool and thrown deck chairs in the deep end. About the time he’d driven to the Golden Gate Bridge and lowered himself onto the suicide nets with his friends. They lay there screaming into the open drop and at the passing ships making their ways out to the far horizon, so hopped up on fear that when they got back to the car he cried. About the lazy afternoons he’d spent in Mill Valley, just walking up and down the downtown streets looking for a thing to do. He told us stories that might have gotten him fired. He never asked us to keep them secret, and in fact many of them circulated. But he did it to make us laugh. He was happy when we laughed, and he laughed with us. His laugh was loud, and he threw his head back and squeezed his eyes shut behind his glasses with such fierce happiness that I couldn’t help but smile. No other teacher ever made me smile like he did. He made silly faces and made fun of himself and sometimes said things that made us uncomfortable, just to get a kick out of seeing us squirm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He could be serious, as well. He could be silent and grave. He was serious when he told us about his son. Of the love he’d had for him. Of the things he would have done to keep him breathing. Of the nights he’d cried because there was nothing he could do to stop the illness. Of holding a nine-year-old boy in his arms and thinking, “He still feels alive.” I only saw him cry once, and it was when he said the word “alive.” He pinched the bridge of his nose under his glasses and shut his eyes and took a shaky breath. A girl sitting by the door stood and went to him and held his hand. We were old enough to know that old men and teachers were only human, but he told me, in many ways, for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he looked at me in the amphitheater that day I graduated high school, I remembered him crying. He looked just as sad, for a moment, as he had that day in class. I laughed, because I was uncomfortable with this sadness. I said, “What?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shook his head. “You looked very grown up just then. Sitting up here all alone. I remember when you were a freshman. You were always messing around. But you looked very grown up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s not a bad thing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No.” He looked at me without expectation. I knew I could take the conversation in one of two ways: I could say something insightful, philosophical, and even prompt him for a few words of advice. Or I could laugh it off, and he would be happy with this just the same, and would keep to himself whatever he’d thought of to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I said, “Aren’t we supposed to grow up?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. [Fakename] played with the tip of his beard. He said, “You’re supposed to grow up, that’s true. But you’ll grow up whether or not you try to.” I didn’t know what to say to this, and after a pause he shrugged. He seemed to know I wanted more. It would have made me feel safe to have him and talk and talk, and all I would have had to do was listen. But he didn’t continue. He only asked, “What were you thinking about, before I came?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A car pulled in to the parking lot. Its headlight cones cut across the darkened lot, and I could see how empty that lot was. I had never seen the school parking lot so empty. “I guess I was trying to make myself feel it. The fact that I’ve graduated.”
He nodded. “Did you feel it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not really,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car stopped. It was a brown Volvo, and I could see Daniel in the driver’s seat. Mr. [Fakename] followed my gaze and said, “Is that you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think so,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He nodded. We stood and walked down the steps and across the field. He was quiet, and I got the sense that he was thinking very hard and that there were many things he wanted to say now. Daniel waved through the windshield. I waved back. I realized that I wanted to slow down so Mr. [Fakename] could say what he had to say, but I didn’t want to let on. I matched his long-legged pace. We walked too fast, and reached the curb without saying anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the curb I turned and said, “Thanks for sitting with me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. [Fakename] stretched out his hand and I shook it. He seemed to realize that I was about to get in the car and drive away, maybe for a very long time. He said, “Come back to visit sometime.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I will.” I put my hand on the car door’s handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All at once, as if he’d been chewing on it for a long time, Mr. [Fakename] said, “And… have a good life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He smiled in that open and knowing way he had, but also in a sheepish way, as if he wasn’t quite sure whether he was being dramatic or not. Whether it was the kind of thing a person could say outside of a movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thank you,” I said. It was all I could think of to say. There was an awkward moment, and then I tugged on the door handle and Mr. [Fakename] stepped off the curb and set off across the parking lot. I looked after him, hoping that he didn’t feel silly, hoping that I’d also said in a way he could hear, “I didn’t think it was weird.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night we drove out to Fort Baker and parked at the end of the road. There was a pier there, Moore Road Pier, and from the pier to the Marin side of the Golden Gate Bridge it was only half a mile. The steel trusses of the bridge overhead looked mythical, like they could only have been built by giants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were six of us and two cars – Daniel’s Volvo and Will’s Land Rover. It was a cold night, with the fog coming in through the gap in land, obscuring the bridge. I thought about all that fog: fog stretching out to the horizon, out to the Farallon Islands, sweeping up and over us and to San Francisco beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pulled out blankets from the back of Will’s car and set out along the pier. At the end of the pier was a square platform. We were far enough from shore that we seemed to be adrift, with the copper orange lights of the bridge high above and coloring the fog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat on a blackened mooring bollard and watched the waves come in. They were smooth, like long sine waves. They didn’t break the mirror of the water; they were gentle hills rolling under all of that surface tension. I thought, “Today something big happened to me.” I tried to feel that it was true, but I couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel came and sat beside me. He pulled off his glasses and rubbed them on his shirt. “How’s it going?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” I said. I watched the waves roll by. I couldn’t see the shore through the fog and the waves were too quiet for me to hear them break. It was as if they went on forever. For some reason, when I looked far to my right to where they faded unbroken into gray, I felt sad. I felt that I could put it into words, too, for the first time that day, and I tried. “Just. A lot is going to change. Everyone talks about their high school years. The people they were in high school. The people they were with when they were young, and how it all changed. I didn’t like high school all that much. But I don’t want you guys, and all the things we did together, to become something someone else did a long time ago.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t have to change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I guess not. It’s just. Everything up until now was mandatory. We lived at home, we did what our parents said, we went to school. Now we can do anything. And if we’re happy in twenty years or bitter, there’s no one to blame but ourselves. And it all starts here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel nodded. A container ship glided into view, tall as a building and ghostly at the edge of obscurity. Daniel didn’t answer for a long time, which I liked. I didn’t try to speak, because I knew he was quiet because he was thinking. He turned to me in the end and said, “Isn’t that kind of exciting?” He looked at me and was serious. I nodded, then smiled, and he smiled too. “It all starts here,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We watched the ship slide under the bridge and into the fog. I knew that if the fog were not there I would see the sheet of ocean and the moonlit sky and the orange lights of container ships in a long line to the horizon. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Don’t want to hurt any feelings, plus I was probably just being mean. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Anyone who went to my high school knows who I’m talking about, but I should also note that the details of his life story / the meeting in the auditorium were fictionalized. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thoughts: I still find some of the imagery really beautiful in its starkness… At the time I guess I accessed “depth” mostly through sadness. The moments I tended to write about were the moments that made me internalize some hollowness or emptiness I’d identified in my life. Which is not to say I was a sad person, I think I just had yet to realize how much depth can be about beauty; I was always able to see the hollowness of thing X, but not the fullness X used to have or the adjacent fullness of some other thing Y that made me cognizant of the hollowness of X. Maybe that’s because I engaged with life mostly by thinking about it – by being introspective – but not by actually doing cool things. On a technical level, I get the sense that the piece was trying too hard to make me feel something. It was insistent but too transparent for its own good, which is to say that a lot of the ideas were (extremely) on the nose… All in all, I don’t hate it, but I also don’t love the person it reveals. But that’s who I was, and I know where I was coming from, so I accept it. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
