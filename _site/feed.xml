I guess in some ill-lit cave at the base of my brain stem, I do, but the human in me is tired and just wants to sleep. But I give a little smile and say Yes, because she is fragile in her offering, because she is timid and the forthrightness is difficult for her. If I told her No it would devastate her. She says Okay. She starts to fumble with the top button of her shirt – she is stiff with nerves, performing this part of a girl who knows what to do here. I laugh and put a hand on her hip and pull her toward where I am seated on the edge of the bed. I say Let me. She looks down at me and her hair falls into my eyes. She laughs now and arranges her hair over her shoulder. I reach for her top button and ask Can I? And she nods. I unbutton her shirt and she shrugs it off and looks at me as if for approval. I slide my hands over her thin shoulders and down to her waist and pretend to be more overcome with desire than I am. Normally I would not have to pretend, but at the moment I want to sleep. I put my head against her stomach and close my eyes. She runs her fingers through my hair and this does give me a rush of pleasure – I have always liked the feeling of someone’s nails tracing over my scalp. It gives me chills. I hook my fingers on the inside of her waistband and make my way around to the front and ask Can I, and she says Yes, and I unbutton her jeans and take them down without opening my eyes. I really am tired. I pull her down and onto my lap and hold onto her, and she holds my head but there is the lingering question of What now? I don’t know how to tell her I just want to sleep. After a minute she says We can just sleep, and I feel myself flush with gratitude. I laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read me, huh, I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can read you, she says softly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fall back into bed and pull her alongside me. She throws a leg over my legs and puts her head on my chest, a hand on the side of my neck. I close my eyes. She looks up at me every once in a while, maybe to check if I am still awake. I drift a bit into the semi-consciousness which is often the closest I can get to sleep with someone else in my bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you still think about her? she asks, so quietly that at first I think I am dreaming. I don’t open my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I say. Yeah. Is that okay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you thinking about her now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to say, I say. I feel her head move against my chest as she nods. She is quiet. I drift again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you wish she was here instead of me? she whispers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city quiets, pressed up in its dim blue light against the blinds. As if to listen in. A train passing under the distant highway overpass groans, and the cars race down Telegraph, their tires hissing on the pavement. Somewhere, an ambulance or fire truck wails and I think it is odd that I enjoy that sound, though it announces emergency, because from far off it reminds me of the city, becomes ambient, loses urgency. I am weightless in the event horizon of sleep. I hear that whisper over and over. It takes my breath away. By the time I realize I have not answered, her breathing is slow and deep and she twitches in the involuntary way of someone dreaming. I approach the asymptote of sleep, thinking of how fucked up I am over her, the other her, hearing that whisper over and over again: Do you wish she was here instead of me?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">something from a freewrite</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">acid</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/01/acid.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="acid" /><published>2020-12-01T21:15:39-08:00</published><updated>2020-12-01T21:15:39-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/12/01/acid</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/01/acid.html">&lt;p&gt;SCENE 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;An auditorium – on stage, a panel of professors chairing a research symposium. Fred, a presenting undergraduate, has just finished his presentation. He shakes a few professors’ hands. He steps off stage and takes his seat in the audience. He turns to his friend Dylan with his mouth agape. His mic is still on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Are you seeing this shit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;DYLAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;DYLAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Ohhh, shit! You’re tripping sack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Laughter in the audience. Confusion among the panelists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t know how the fuck I made it through that. That tab is kicking my ass up and down the astral plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The professors catch on. They try to get Fred’s attention but he doesn’t notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;DYLAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You seeing things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;My mind is a speaker and God’s on aux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;DYLAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t even know what that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m riding a dreamcatcher in the sixth dimension through the Late Cretaceous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;DYLAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Late! The Late Cretaceous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No, I know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;An administrator comes on stage from the wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ADMINISTRATOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Uhh–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I swear, any great thinker who denies mysticism or spirituality has never dropped acid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ADMINISTRATOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Mr. Thomas–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(twirling a finger around his temple)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;In here? Interdimensional whale song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;DYLAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;The fuck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Like Dory from Finding Nemo? Awooooooo! Except she’s a multistellar omniscient life form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ADMINISTRATOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Could we fix Mr. Thomas’s mic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m in the bookshelf room from Interstellar shaking hands with the librarian. Spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;DYLAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You’re talking spiritual handshake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;It doesn’t have hands.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">the beginnings of a scene i freewrote for fun</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">fall and benny</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/09/fall-and-benny.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="fall and benny" /><published>2020-05-09T22:15:39-07:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T22:15:39-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/05/09/fall-and-benny</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/09/fall-and-benny.html">&lt;figure&gt;

    ...these friends, in fact! james read for bennie and katherine read for fall (over zoom, just for fun)
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCENE 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Bennie and Fall sit on a bench in Central Park. Or rather Fall lies along the length of the bench  with a book over her face and Bennie sits on the cement beside it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You indulge in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You indulge in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You– you– you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(he gestures grandly with his hands)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You make it this big thing. This big show of, like, how fucked up your life is and how dark it is in your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I feel like that’s a fucked up thing to say to someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;But I mean… Well, hold on – aren’t you saying that my life isn’t fucked up then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I never said that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;By implication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Well then you’re implying – err, inferring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;That’s what people do, people infer. We’re inferring machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;That’s not my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;And when you say things, you leave little spaces where the other person can infer, but not so big that they fall through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You’re doing it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You’re going abstract on me, you’re not talking to me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Now that’s abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No, you’re lecturing at the world. You’re talking to the birds or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Are you saying my life isn’t fucked up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I never said that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;So you agree that my life is fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I agree that it can be fucked up. Has been fucked up. From time to time. But is? I don’t know. That’s a big thing to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What’re you thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You’re not reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Furthermore, you’re aware that this is the kind of choice that will cast a lingering shadow. Every choice is a renunciation, or an infinity of renunciations. You will be forever after aware of the road not taken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;How are you doing that. It’s on your face. The book is on your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m just doing it. How are you doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Doing what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(nods appreciatively)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Fuckin’ A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You never say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m trying it out. I wanna be the kind of person who says, “Fuckin’ A” like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;That was cool… The– what you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Thanks… I liked the “Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah. It came out real natural. Like, “Fuckin’ A.” Just like that. Like in a movie. “Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;A woman passing with a small dog squints at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(at the dog)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(more confused than angry)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What did you say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I was talking to your dog… I said, “Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Oh. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The woman leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Fucking bitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t know. She was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Maybe you need a cigarette. To do the, “Fuckin’ A.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I think I want to fight my landlord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah, I don’t know. Like, he’s never really done anything to me. But I still feel like he’s– He’s my landlord, you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Like, he’s got something on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;And I don’t like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;So I think I wanna fight him. Or at least, like, I wanna want to fight him. Or like fantasize about it. Or like yell at him, like, “You motherfucker!” And then something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Why don’t you just do it now. Like, what would you say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Like, “You motherfucker!” Something like that. Like, “You fucking want me to pay… rent? And, like, live in this shitty apartment? And, like, every time I pass you on the stairs and you’re sweeping you give me this look that’s like, ‘Who are you?’ and it’s like, ‘I live here–’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(he groans)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Nevermind. That was stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No, it was good. I really felt something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah. I felt like, “Woah,” for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Listen, I think I’m gonna go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Bennie wanders off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Eighty-three percent of all corporate mergers fail to create any value for shareholders, and these mergers are only made after months and years of analysis…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Lights down on him talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCENE 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;A party in Fall’s apartment. Music is blaring and people are packed in. Bennie and Fall gyrate awkwardly but confidently. A WOMAN comes up to Fall and shouts in his ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;There’s someone at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay, let them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t think it’s that kind of person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Whaddaya mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I think they’re angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(she makes a “not my problem” face and walks away)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(to Bennie)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I wanna kick her out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You can’t kick people out just because they say something you don’t like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;It’s my place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah, but this is a party, not, like, an inquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Come back me up at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;They go to the door and open it. Their landlord, Job Renkins, stands there furious. He does a lot of strong pointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What the fuck is going on in here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Hi, Job Renkins. We’re having a party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You can’t have a party! There are no parties here! You can’t do this– I mean, I’m blown away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;It’s just a small one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Just a small one? I mean – I’m blown away. Can you imagine the inconsideration!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Inconsiderate to who?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;To your neighbors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I think it’s “whom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;“Whom?” We invited all the neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;It’s the object of the sentence, not the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Oh, that’s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t care. Are you listening to me? I don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Job Renkins, come on. It’s 11PM on a Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t care what time it is! And you don’t have to call me “Job Renkins,” you can just say “Job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Mr. Job Renkins, it’s just a little one. It’s a very little one – you can come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t want to come in! I want everybody out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(to Bennie)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Landlords are like vampires. You have to invite them in… Fuck, that didn’t land, did it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Is that true? Oh, it’s a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I want everybody out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Look, Mr. Job Renkins, if you’re not coming in, I’m going to have to close the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;JOB RENKINS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No– no!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m sorry, but you’re letting all the sound into the hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;He closes the door. Job Renkins pounds on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I don’t know if you should have done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Well I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;That’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;They stand there a moment listening to Job Renkins screaming at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;SCENE 2.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;A pretty woman stands around talking to Fall and Bennie. She’s trying to talk to Fall mostly, because he’s pretty as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Do? Most days I guess I just sit around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;She means for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Oh, for work–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;We’re both retired tech trash. Err, well, not really retired. More just like we quit. Yeah, we quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;We quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;You quit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;How old are you? Oh, sorry – I guess that’s rude–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No, no. I’m 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;And you quit. For good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I mean, that would be retired. We’re not retired. Can’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Sort of just waiting around for the money to run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah, I mean, it sounds kind of funny, but we both just decided we didn’t want to work anymore and so we stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;BENNIE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Worked for a few years in “the valley” as they say…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(no one laughs and he groans)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;So then hit a wall and just quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yeah, like sort of a soul wall. Like a wall in our souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Like, “beneath all of the performed happiness and scripted fullness of Silicon Valley life lies a deep-seated discontent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;What was that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I was quoting something. Or, like, that could be a quote. I just said it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ALLEGRA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I’m going to get another drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;FALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;All right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(to Bennie)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;I wanna kick her out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">a couple of nonsensical play scenes i wrote for some friends</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">good life</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/20/good-life.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="good life" /><published>2020-03-20T22:15:39-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-20T22:15:39-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/03/20/good-life</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/20/good-life.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-do-you-believe-makes-for-a-life-well-lived-and-what-are-the-ways-in-which-your-actions-do-or-dont-align-with-that-overarching-purpose&quot;&gt;What do you believe makes for a life well lived, and what are the ways in which your actions do (or don’t) align with that overarching purpose?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to come up with an exhaustive definition of the good life. It’s all approximate. There is always something lost by putting intangibles into words, and it’s pointless to go about fiddling with semantics and qualifying statements in pursuit of exactitude because that could go on indefinitely. All of this is to say that everything that follows is reductionist to some degree. But here goes. If I had to identify what I think makes for a life well lived I would say there are two components: fulfilling relationships and fulfilling work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oxford Dictionary defines fulfilling as “making someone satisfied or happy because of fully developing their character or abilities.” I define fulfilling as “making someone satisfied or happy by fostering progress in developing their character or abilities.” No one is ever fully developed, but that which is fulfilling to me encourages (or even guarantees) a sense of continual development. The things in my life that are fulfilling force me to move forward. They deny me the chance to stagnate.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By fulfilling work, I mean work that engages me, that challenges me and gives me a sense that there are mountains left to climb and that these mountains are worth climbing. I think challenge is important to me because it makes me unhappy to ever feel that I’ve plateaued or that I’ve used my time poorly. I take a lot of pleasure from learning every day, and from looking back on each year in wonder at how much I have grown. This pleasure is what I demand from fulfilling work in return for my time. Maybe this definition comes close to that of a passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that I find multiple sources of fulfilling work in my life. Hobbies, sports, and careers are all types of work, and they are fulfilling so long as they make me feel that I’m becoming a better or more whole person through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, my sense of individuality or identity feeds into my work and vice versa. Not in that I define myself by my work, but in that I see my work as an expression of self. In &lt;em&gt;The Communist Manifesto&lt;/em&gt; Marx talks about how the problem with work under industrial capitalism is that it is soulless. In contrast, the independent craftsperson (say, a shoemaker) puts some sense of their identity into their products. Their shoes are a form of self-expression. Only they can produce their particular shoes. I’m no goddamned Commie. But fulfilling work should have this sense of entanglement with my individuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By fulfilling relationships, I mean relationships that make me feel happy and whole and comfortable, sure, but I also mean relationships that foster that sense of progress by which I defined fulfillment. A fulfilling relationship is one that challenges me to be better, to step outside of my comfort zone, and to understand different ways of viewing the world or interacting with people. This implies that fulfilling relationships should often be with people who are very different from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;my friends!&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/couch.jpeg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;my friends!&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/fancy_party.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    some fulfilling relationships :)
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could further divide relationships into the romantic, the core friendships, and the peripheral friendships – all of which I think are important. The romantic, or love, gives life some of its spark. It makes it exciting. A fulfilling love is one that isn’t just exciting for its novelty or for the potential energy it represents before it is realized (because these things fade after a while). It is exciting because the other person is a constant source of novelty. They see the world in a way that is refreshing or surprising to me again and again, and because of this I learn to see the world newly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core friendships in my life grant me a sense of being truly known and of having unconditional support. Just like good romantic partners, they are a constant source of novelty, and hopefully I am a source of novelty to them. This implies that we are often introducing each other to new ways of viewing things, and as such, a certain level of open discussion and disagreement is a good sign of a healthy close friendship. These people are the family I choose and I’m lucky to have them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peripheral friends are the people I see once in a while or maybe only in certain settings, and while they contribute less to my happiness than my core friends, they still add to my life. They give me a sense of being socially engaged, of being open to new social opportunities, and of always having a rich social frontier that changes and adapts. Core friends often start as peripheral friends, which is what makes this frontier exciting. Having these people around encourages me to develop socially rather than stagnating. It also gives me a sense that I am a member of a bigger community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding how these components contribute to an “overarching purpose,” I would say that both fulfilling relationships and fulfilling work are sources of both purpose and meaning. But I want to draw a distinction between purpose and meaning. Purpose, to me, is an animating force. It’s a reason to get up in the morning. Fulfilling work is primarily a source of purpose, because it is a source of everyday action in pursuit of a long-term goal. Meaning is a found thing. It’s interpreted. Fulfilling relationships are primarily sources of meaning, because the people we surround ourselves with lend us their worldviews, philosophies, and methods of reconciling the irreconcilable in life. Of course, these two forces are entangled. Meaning arises from purpose: there is no intrinsic meaning to life for me, only the meaning we make. And purpose facilitates that making of our own meaning because it propels us down some path and determines which world we see. To use a tired analogy, if life is a series of crossroads, purpose determines the turns we make, and meaning is what we make of those turns. It informs what we make of the sights we see as we travel. A rich sense of meaning is a good indicator that one has purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I see myself as enacting this vision of the good life? I’m working on it. I’m learning how to find fulfilling work and fulfilling relationships both. I’m not sure how I’m doing and I’m definitely not sure where I’m going. But I’m making progress, slowly, and given that this is a sign of fulfillment, I’d say that I’m on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The terms “guarantee,” “force me,” and “deny me” may be too strong. Under these definitions, fulfillment is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for goodness, because overwork, for example, forces you to make progress but I wouldn’t consider it good. Fulfillment in this case is a sort of lower bound and requires a matching upper bound – though maybe overwork undoes progress in the realm of character development and is therefore by definition not fulfilling. I’m not sure. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

On day one, I watched Denero write one line of code and produce every palindrome in Shakespeare’s collected works. I imagined how much time it would take to do this myself – to read every play, to scan every line, and to find every word written the same backwards and forwards. I was hooked. To me, learning CS was like watching someone explain a magic trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he taught me how it worked, it erased some of the wonder, of course. But it was fascinating and beautiful and elegant and when the trick finally clicked there was the “Aha!” moment of understanding how I had been duped. Then I could turn around, that very same day, and perform the trick myself – for my friends, for my parents, for anyone. I could iterate on it and generalize it, and that was intoxicating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I learned more and understood how CS was a study of abstractions, I found that I could always go deeper. Once I had learned all of the tricks in one stage it was revealed that all of these tricks were built on deeper, more elemental forms of magic. Python is interpreted into C which is run through a compiler which compiles C to assembly which is run through a linker and passed to a loader to be translated to machine code to be run on a processor. The processor has a data-path which is made up of circuit blocks which is made up of combinatorial logic units and state elements. Software all the way down to the metal, and there the realm of electrical engineering and physics begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At every step, I was a child asking, “Why? Why? Why?” and at every step there was an answer. Logic all the way through the stack. It was dizzying and beautiful.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Either way is fine – I’m not here to tell anyone they must read the news. But I want to figure out why I like to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to build an understanding of the state of things in the world, even if these things are way beyond me in scale and scope. Even if they will likely never affect me and I will likely never affect them. It helps to me to contextualize my tiny experience in my tiny corner of the world and to recognize this tininess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also helps me to understand what I believe (in). Days roll by and turn into weeks which turn into months and years, and only in retrospect do scholars get to decide what mattered and what didn’t. The events that make up history are often so large that they seem way beyond the scope of one individual. But I like to think that I am like a fish in water – swimming in what will one day be history but too steeped in it to recognize it as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news is a slice of history. Still vast in scale compared to me, but one elemental part of the big story. Slightly more accessible. And sometimes I get a whiff of history in the making in the news. And it helps me to see what change in the world will be remembered as positive and what will be seen as negative. It forces me to think about big things like values and beliefs and causes. It forces me out of my daily routine and my petty obsessions and demands some recognition of the fact that I am living through history and participating in it, that every day people of flesh and bone just like me choose to manifest good and evil and I can too – that there are causes worth fighting for, that there are problems left unsolved, that there are more valuable things I can do with my time than just secure my own prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people report that the news makes them pessimistic. I think it makes me more idealistic. Because it reveals that history is not mythology, is not abstraction, but is the collected action of real people who appeared in the news, likely, when their time came.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m rambling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason I like to read the news: it isn’t free. Real journalists – underpaid, overcaffeinated, sleep-deprived and ambitious – work hard to find sources, hunt leads, debate ethics, protect identities, check facts, edit copy, and make deadlines, so that the public can be informed. Maybe they do it out of the conviction that what they do is important for the health of democracy, which as &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reminds us, “dies in darkness.” Maybe they do it because it’s a job. Regardless, they do it, and they often paint targets on their backs in doing so (whether this means risking petty office bullshit or beatings and torture).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I’m romanticizing journalists. But how many other professions require daily introspection about the morality of the work? Journalists butt heads in meetings all the time over questions of journalistic integrity – whether the testimony of an anonymous source is worth the loss in credibility, whether interviewing a victim of cartel violence puts them at greater risk of retaliatory attacks, whether they can be certain that the allegations they are publishing aren’t libelous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is that the articles in the news are the end product of a long process that is guided by conviction and integrity, and that kind of product is rare. To turn away from it because it isn’t always uplifting would be to trivialize the work of many and to ignore the beauty of their intentions in doing said work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I hear often about the news is that there’s nothing a reader can do about the injustices they read about, which makes reading a futile exercise. But this is misguided, I think. Being informed is doing something. Knowing is enough. Often, journalism is about giving a voice to people who don’t have it. Amplifying the story of an abused immigrant mother with all of the institutional prestige of the great &lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/em&gt; (all caps intended). Shining the light into the shadows to strip the perpetrators of their mystique and reveal them as what they are – humans, just humans. Among a readership of millions, there may be tens or even hundreds of people in a position to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, sure, maybe I can’t take action re: every story I read. But the capacity for action begins with information. Probably I can’t do anything about some randomly chosen article. But if I don’t read it I rob myself of the chance, and reading it makes me better equipped to mobilize in the future. Maybe one day I will be among the ten or the hundred who can do something. And if not, I’m one of the millions who know that injustice has occurred and who recognize that it is injustice. That recognition is the beating heart of the common morality, the consensus of the people re: what is right and what is wrong. It moves the compass that guides a democracy. Being informed is part of being a responsible… citizen? Person?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news isn’t always pretty because the world isn’t. But the news is a reflection of that worldly ugliness which arises from the darker natures of everyday people. To turn away from it because it is unpleasant would be to shirk the responsibility of introspection. It would be to shut out the voices of the less fortunate because they aren’t saying what I want to hear. It would be willful ignorance in exchange for artificial comfort. And that seems pretty cheap to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">a thing (essay? rant?) i wrote about why i like to read the news and think people should</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">ace</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/12/02/ace.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ace" /><published>2019-12-02T21:15:39-08:00</published><updated>2019-12-02T21:15:39-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/12/02/ace</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/12/02/ace.html">&lt;p&gt;Last night I was woken by lightning. Or probably by the thunder that followed quickly behind – the loudest thunder I have ever heard. I leapt to my feet and went to the window without thinking. Pressed my hands against the shuddering glass. Felt my heart in my throat and thought the world was coming to an end. A primal reaction to an animal fear. When I pieced it together I went back to bed. A minute later the room lit up again and the thunder came a half-second later. Close. Very close. Ace whimpered in the hall and I went to comfort him. I laid my head near his head and slept by his side.&lt;/p&gt;

My parents always used to say that after a certain point the milestones grow few and far between and thirty, then forty, comes before you know it. I treated this with the usual youthful skepticism. But recently, in wrestling with the torturous question of my career (“What do you want to do after graduating?”) I see how this might be true. How one temporary ambition may lead to another. How so many holdovers put in place to make room to breathe and think and plan might string together into ten years or twenty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear the same sort of indecision in my friends’ voices when we talk. “If only we could slow the pace,” we all seem to be saying. But I know that I could sit here forever drafting up possible futures and never picking one. That the only way to decide is to try and err and try again and find contentment eventually in some local optimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, my friends and I talk and make crackpot schemes as thin as tissue paper based on criteria we don’t quite feel as real yet like “profitability” or “stability.” But I can see how these schemes could harden into plans into schedules into routines. I can see how easy it would be to forget that they were arbitrary, that they were gossamer strands met by desperate hands relieved to grasp at anything solid. That they were adopted merely as a thing to say. As a ready answer to the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s all right. Because life is non-convex. There is no closed form solution, the error surface is riddled with local minima, and only stochastic iterative methods exist to optimize it. Stochastic because we are bad at optimizing in multiple dimensions at once. This is all part of the process. I’m not afraid of the local minimum. I’m just afraid that I will mistake happenstance for destiny, because then I will be stuck, too afraid to reinitialize with a random starting vector. I’m not afraid of the descent. I’m just afraid it will feel like falling.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">some thoughts i wrote down on the arbitrariness of making big decisions</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">blinds</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/03/27/blinds.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="blinds" /><published>2019-03-27T22:15:39-07:00</published><updated>2019-03-27T22:15:39-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/03/27/blinds</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/03/27/blinds.html">&lt;p&gt;The light was gray and weak coming through the vertical blinds, and when I turned my head to match the angle of the slats I could see the sky beyond, as low and gray as an augury. Dust blackened the edges of the slats and piled on the blades of the broken ceiling fan. Maybe it wasn’t dust but ash from the cigarettes Will and I smoked indoors too frequently. Will slept on the other side of the bedroom, in his bed which was no more than six feet from mine and striped with the light coming through the window. One bar of light fell over his face and I wondered how he didn’t stir. I woke with the slightest hint of day; some days I woke just with the brightening of the eastern rim of the world, not even the rising of the sun. I wondered if Will knew how long the morning could be in coming. How it could stretch out for hours from that first lifting of the darkness to the stirrings of the streets outside, with me all the while blinking in the dimness and lying still so as not to be awake just yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">another short freewrite</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">coma</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/01/28/coma.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="coma" /><published>2019-01-28T21:15:39-08:00</published><updated>2019-01-28T21:15:39-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/01/28/coma</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/01/28/coma.html">&lt;p&gt;Laughing, he is laughing. He is biking down a city street and the rain is coming down hard, so hard that it drums on the tops of parked cars and roars against the plastic of his drawn-up hood. The pitted asphalt under his wheels is laminated with a skin of water and the gutters on either side run full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He glances backward to check for cars but there are no cars on the road and he bombs through an empty intersection without looking at the traffic light. He doesn’t care. The rain makes him feel free and giddy; he pedals into it and it blinds him. His wheels spinning on the wet asphalt sound like oil hissing in a pan. There is nobody on the sidewalk as far as he can see: as far as he can see he is completely alone, and the street rolls down and down until it comes to the broad flat expanse of the bay and the bay disappears into the fog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On either side of the road are apartment buildings and parking lots, all of them gray, around eight stories tall. He is full of hate for these buildings, but he can’t remember why, and he pedals harder so that he is flying impossibly fast on the skin of water, hydroplaning maybe, he isn’t sure, and he feels weightless. He thinks suddenly that the world is still swimming, is still in flux. He remembers a clip from a film he saw when he was young of the Earth from afar with the continents drifting to and from and merging and dividing on its surface. He feels that the rain is washing away the trash on the streets and the dirt on the streets and the streets themselves; the rain is washing away the city and the bedrock of the continent; the world is not yet decided. This is a beautiful thought. He latches on to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain is torrential. The sidewalks flood and the sewers spill over and the bay in the distance begins to creep upward. A parking garage on his left begins to shift and on the right an apartment building slips down the hill a few feet and down by the next intersection the asphalt begins to crack and sag. The dirt underlying it all is eaten away by flood waters and now the buildings begin to crumble and slide, really slide, and the asphalt disappears under streams of running water and then it is just a river, a river of white-water rapids. The cars begin to float, and an apartment building floats by on his left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He begins to sink, and he wonders where the asphalt has gone, because as his head goes under he sees that the city has fallen away. There are miles of deep water below him; though he can only see a few hundred feet down he knows there are miles below. If he looks straight down there is blackness, pure blackness, and around him the deep blue fades. He is pedaling on a falling bike. He looks to his left. Beams of sunlight slant downward toward the blackness, and a parking lot, with its crumbling concrete pillars and twisted rebar, tumbles downward in silence. It passes him. An apartment tower falls by on his right; he can see into the windows. A couch and a desk are pressed against the ceiling in one apartment. In another, papers swirl like leaves in a tea cup. More buildings fall past him. A school bus. A police car. He watches them as they pitch downward in their weightlessness and grow faint and are swallowed by the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He realizes that he is going to the darkness. He is afraid of this, very afraid. The light is dying around him, and when he peers into the distance he sees a swelling shadow moving slowly against the dark blue – something like a whale, bigger than he has ever seen. This frightens him too. He thinks that there is some place he must get back to, or someone, but he doesn’t remember and it is pointless to try. He is filled with a sense that these things are abnormal, but he can’t think of why. It is like something, he would say if he had to explain himself. It is like being in something, but even this he can’t remember. Everything is dark around him. He isn’t sure whether he is approaching the darkness or whether he is in it already. The sense of oddness is gone, as is the fear, and now he is calm. He feels good, even. But sad, as well, because there was some place he had to get back to. He is beyond this, he is naked and everything is dark and truly dark – for the first time when he looks down at himself he sees blackness, nothing, no light to see his body. He can’t tell if he still has eyes, there is nothing to see, and he closes them, he thinks. He is beginning to dissolve away, he thinks, he isn’t sure there is a he to speak of. He is sad, and an image comes to him unbidden. There is a boy, young, maybe six years old, with brown hair and glasses. His eyes are green, the corners of his mouth are turned up in a smile that is like a secret passed between good friends. He laughs. It is autumn, and the boy stands in a grove of half-bare trees and the ground is carpeted in orange leaves. He crouches and picks up a stick and gestures at a pile of leaves where a potato bug sits, its antennae twitching. The boy looks up and says something and laughs. There is a woman, somewhere, who laughs. This is a beautiful sound. The image of the autumn grove falls away and there is only blackness but the sound remains, and the blackness is full of happiness, and the blackness, too, fades.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">a freewrite from one of my notebooks</summary></entry></feed>
