I"ø<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Maxime, a researcher, student, and writer from the Bay Area. I graduated from UC Berkeley, where I studied computer science and creative writing, in December 2021. Now I work in a lab at Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research, investigating deep-learning based methods for image compression.*</p>

    It's me! (Just two weeks after having my right hip reconstructed, actually -- cropped out on the left are the crutches I used for around 3 months.)

<p>When Iâ€™m not learning cool things about computer vision, I like to write. Thatâ€™s what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notebook_0</code> is for: itâ€™s an informal place for me to share essays, fiction, play scenes, and other content. The hope is that this site will give me a place to point people who are curious about the kinds of things I write. I also hope that publishing snippets here every once in a while will incentivize me to write more and write freely, without much pressure to polish or revise my drafts.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and as always, if youâ€™re one of my friends and suspect Iâ€™m writing about youâ€¦ everything herein is fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental :)</p>
