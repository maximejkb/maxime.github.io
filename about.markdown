Hi! I'm Maxime, a researcher, student, and writer from the Bay Area. I graduated from UC Berkeley, where I studied computer science and creative writing, in December 2020. I have worked in the past at a startup,
a big tech company, and in finance. Now I work in a computer vision lab at Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research, investigating deep-learning based methods for melanoma segmentation. My previous research focused on deep-learning based image compression[^1]. My full resume can be found [here][resume].

When I'm not researching AI, I like to write. While I am still defining my areas of focus, I aim to use my background to write about AI and technology. I also aim to produce data-driven, computational, and investigative journalism [^2].
