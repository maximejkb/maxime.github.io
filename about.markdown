Hi! I'm Maxime, a researcher, student, and writer from the Bay Area. I graduated from UC Berkeley, where I studied computer science and creative writing, in December 2020. Now I work in a computer vision lab at Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research, investigating deep-learning based methods for melanoma detection and neural-network based image compression[^1]. I have worked in the past at a startup,
a big tech company, and in finance. My full resume can be found [here][resume].

When I'm not researching AI, I like to write. I have published short fiction, essays, and journalism, and have been selected for workshops in short fiction and playwriting. I have three years of journalism experience, serving as a reporter, copy editor, art director, and opinion columnist for _Redwood Bark_. I also served as a reader for the literary journal _Berkeley Fiction Review_.

While I am still defining my areas of focus, I aim to use my background to write about AI and technology. I also aim to produce data-driven, computational, and investigative journalism [^2].
