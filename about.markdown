Hi! I'm Maxime, a researcher, student, and writer from the Bay Area. I graduated from UC Berkeley, where I studied computer science and creative writing, in December 2021. Now I work in a lab at Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research, investigating deep-learning based methods for image compression.*

    It's me! (Just two weeks after having my right hip reconstructed -- cropped out on the left are the crutches I used for around 3 months.)

When I'm not learning cool things about computer vision, I like to write. That's what `notebook_0` is for: it's an informal place for me to share essays, fiction, play scenes, and other content. The hope is that this site will give me a place to point people who are curious about the kinds of things I write. I also hope that publishing snippets here every once in a while will incentivize me to write more and write freely, without much pressure to polish or revise my drafts.

Thanks for reading, and as always, if you're one of my friends and suspect I'm writing about you... everything herein is fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental :)
